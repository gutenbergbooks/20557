<h4>PREFACE<a name="pgvii" id="pgvii"></a></h4>

<p>This Manual is issued for the purpose of encouraging the
introduction and furthering the progress of Household Science in
the rural schools of this Province. There are 903 urban and 5,697
rural schools, and 45.87% of the school population is in attendance
at the latter schools. The value of Household Science as an
educational and practical subject has been recognized, to some
extent, in the urban schools of the Province but, up to the
present, little attempt has been made to give the subject a place
among the activities of the rural schools.</p>

<p>There is a wide-spread impression that it is not possible in
Household Science to give any instruction that is of value without
the provision of separate rooms, elaborate equipment, and specially
trained teachers. Where these conditions exist, of course, the best
work can be accomplished; but, even where they cannot be realized,
much may be done toward giving definite, useful instruction in the
cardinal principles of home-making, which should be learned by
every girl. There is certainly not a single rural school where some
practical work in sewing and some valuable lessons in the care of
the home may not be given. As for cookery, it is doubtful if there
is a single school so small and so helpless that it is unable to
use the hot noon-day lunch as a method of approach to this branch of
the subject.</p>

<p>Students of the physical welfare of children are rapidly coming
to the conclusion that a warm mid-day meal greatly increases the
efficiency of the pupil and determines <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pgviii" id="pgviii">viii</a></span>to a large extent the
results of the afternoon's study. There are other benefits to be
derived from a school lunch well prepared under proper conditions.
In many communities it has been the means of bringing about a
healthy and satisfactory co-operation between the school and the
home, of developing a higher social life in the neighbourhood, and
of introducing into the school a Household Science course, which
has proved as great a benefit to the farmer's wife as to his
children.</p>

<p>This Manual deals entirely with conditions that exist in our
rural schools and outlines only such plans and schemes as can be
carried out, even in adverse circumstances, by alert trustees,
sympathetic inspectors, and resourceful teachers.</p>

<p>Permission has been obtained from the Bureau of Education,
Washington, U.S.A., to make use of a recently issued
bulletin&mdash;"Three Courses in Home-making for Rural Schools",
and of various bulletins issued by State Agricultural Colleges. The
freest use has been made of this material, and the permission to do
so is hereby gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>Only such theory as can be readily assimilated has been given;
and the teacher is advised for further information and help to
consult the Manuals issued by the Department of Education on
<i>Household Management</i> and <i>Sewing</i>. Those who wish to
become thoroughly competent and to earn the highest Departmental
grants should attend the Summer Schools provided by the Department
of Education. Under certain conditions the expenses of teachers
attending these courses are paid by the Department.</p>

<p>Nothing has been included or recommended that cannot be
accomplished in the average rural school; and trustees, teachers,
and inspectors are urged to make a beginning <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pgix" id="pgix">ix</a></span>by selecting the
lessons that appeal to them as being most suitable to the districts
in which their schools are situated.</p>

<p>By careful planning and a wise use of the time before and after
school and during recess, the regular organization of the school
need not be interfered with; and, in addition to the educational
and social advantages to be derived from undertaking this work,
much benefit will result from the increased interest taken in the
school by the parents and the general public.</p>

<p>It is not essential that the lessons in this Manual should be
taken exactly in the order given. Any other arrangement called for
by the peculiar circumstances of the school is admissible.</p>

<p>The Inspector of Manual Training and Household Science is ready
at all times to visit rural schools for the purpose of conferring
with the Public School Inspectors, the trustees, and the teachers
regarding the introduction of Household Science as a regular
subject of the school curriculum.</p>

<div class="smcap_header">HOUSEHOLD SCIENCE IN RURAL SCHOOLS</div>

<h3>THREE SHORT COURSES IN HOME-MAKING</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The three brief courses in home-making outlined in this Manual
have been especially prepared for use in elementary rural schools.
They are in no sense complete outlines of the subjects with which
they deal; rather, they indicate a few of the important phases of
food study, sewing, and the care of the home with which the pupil
in the elementary school should become familiar. The underlying
thought for each problem should be: "Will this help the pupils to
live more useful lives, and will it lead to better conditions in
their homes?"</p>

<p>The lessons are purposely made simple, and the plans are
definitely outlined, so that even the inexperienced teacher may be
able to achieve a certain measure of success. The experienced
teacher will find in them suggestions that may be of value in the
further development of the course.</p>

<p>The teacher who desires to use this course will necessarily have
to adapt it to her own community, and it is hoped that she may be
able to do this with but little alteration. While conditions of
living and choice of foods differ in various parts of the Province,
the general principles of nutrition, the rules of sanitation, and
the methods of cooking and serving are much the same for all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg002" id=
"pg002">002</a></span>Owing to the difficulty of securing time on
the programme for frequent lessons in home-making, each of the
courses has been limited to twenty lessons. Some teachers may not
be able to have a greater number of lessons during the school year,
and they may find it well to carry the three courses through three
successive years. In other schools, where more frequent lessons can
be given, it may be well to offer all three courses during one
year. The courses in cooking and the care of the home can be
advantageously combined, as many of the problems in both are
related. The lessons in sewing may be given on another day of the
week, or it may be well to give them early in the year, to be
followed, later, by the cooking lessons. Thus an opportunity will
be furnished for the making of the cooking aprons and the hemming
of the towels.</p>

<p>It is most desirable that periods of at least forty minutes
should be provided for all the practical lessons. Longer periods
will be necessary for some of them, such as the preparation and the
serving of a meal. If no practical work is undertaken in the
lesson, a forty-minute period is sufficient.</p>

<h4>LIBRARY ON HOME ECONOMICS FOR THE RURAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>In addition to the text-books recommended as sources of special
reference for the rural teacher, the following books, bearing on
home economics or on methods of teaching, are suggested for the
rural school library. These books have been chosen with the
threefold purpose of providing references for the teachers, reading
matter for the pupils, and a lending library for the parents.</p>

<h3>TWENTY LESSONS IN THE CARE OF THE HOME</h3>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER</h4>

<p>The purpose of this course is to give the pupils instruction in
various household tasks, in order that better living conditions may
be secured in the homes. The beauty and sacredness of an ideal home
life should receive emphasis, so that the pupils may be impressed
with the importance of conscientious work in the performance of
their daily household duties. They should have some insight into
the sanitary, economic, and social problems that are involved in
housekeeping, so that they may develop an increased appreciation of
the importance of the home-maker's work.</p>

<p>The two most important things to be taught are "cleanliness and
order". Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the value of fresh
air and sunshine and the necessity for the free use of hot water
and soap. The value of property should also be emphasized. Economy
in the purchase and handling of house furnishings and equipment
should be considered. Instruction should also be given in the care
of foods and clothing and in the care and arrangement of furniture.
Simple instruction in the care of babies should be given, since the
older children are often responsible, to some extent, for the care
of the younger members of their families.</p>

<p>In some of the lessons more subjects may be suggested than the
teacher will have time to take up in a single period. In that case
it will be well for her to choose the subject which seems most
vital to the immediate needs of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg005" id="pg005">005</a></span>the community. In many cases she
may be able to give an increased number of lessons. Practice and
drill in all of the processes involved in housewifery are essential
to successful training.</p>

<p>If a cupboard and a table have been arranged for the use of the
cooking classes, most of the suggested work can be carried out with
the school equipment. Where there is no equipment in the school and
school conditions do not approximate home conditions, it may be
possible to secure permission to give the lesson after school hours
in the home of one of the pupils who lives nearby.</p>

<p>In each lesson the teacher, while giving the pupils helpful
general information on the subject under discussion, should strive
to impress on them the importance of doing some one simple thing
well.</p>

<p>The rural teacher who is eager to make her school-room an
attractive place may devote some time in these lessons to such
problems as the hanging and the care of simple curtains, the care
of indoor plants, the arrangement of pictures, the planning of
storage arrangements for supplies and of cupboards for dishes, and
the preparations for the serving of the school lunch.</p>

<p>In order to teach these lessons effectively, it is desirable to
have the following simple equipment on hand. Additional special
equipment may be borrowed from the homes.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON I: ARRANGEMENT AND CARE OF THE
KITCHEN</div>


<h5>SUBJECT-MATTER</h5>

<p>In arranging the kitchen, the three things of most importance
are the stove, the sink, and the kitchen table. If there is no sink
in the kitchen, there will be some other place arranged for washing
the dishes, probably the kitchen table, and this must be taken into
consideration when the furniture is placed. As most of the work is
done at the stove and the table, both these must be placed where
they will have a good light, and they should be close to each
other, so that but few steps are necessary for the worker.</p>

<p>In furnishing the kitchen, the housekeeper will find a high
stool very useful, as it will enable her to wash dishes, prepare
vegetables, and do other work while seated.</p>

<p>All the furniture should be kept so clean and free from dust
that the kitchen will have a neat and attractive appearance. A vase
of flowers or a potted plant, and a washable table-cover to be used
after the dishes have been put away, will help to make this room a
pleasant place for the family. Special attention should be given to
the ventilation.</p>

<p>The kitchen should be thoroughly cleaned after each meal. If it
has become dusty or disarranged, it should be put in order before
the next meal is to be prepared. While the cooking is under way,
everything should be kept in an orderly condition. As soon as the
meal is completed, the left-over food should be covered and put
away; the scraps and waste material should be gathered and disposed
of; and the dishes, pots, and pans should be scraped, and washed in
hot, soapy water, then rinsed in clear, hot water, dried, and put
away. The table should be scrubbed, the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg008" id="pg008">008</a></span>stove cleaned, the floor
swept and scrubbed whenever necessary, and everything put neatly in
its place.</p>

<p><i>Care of the coal or wood range.</i>&mdash;All spots should be
removed from the range by wiping it with old paper. If it is in bad
condition, it should be washed with soap and water. If it is oiled
occasionally, blacking will not be necessary; but if blacking is
used, it should be applied with a cloth and rubbed to a polish with
a brush, just as the fire is being started. The ashes and soot
flues back of the oven and underneath it should be cleaned out once
a week.</p>

<p><i>Directions for building a fire.</i>&mdash;To build and care
for a fire in the coal or wood range, close all the dampers, clean
the grate, and remove the ashes from the pan. Put on the covers and
brush the dust off the stove. Open the creative damper and the oven
damper, leaving the check damper closed. Lay some paper, slightly
crumpled into rolls, across the base of the grate. Place small
pieces of kindling wood across one another, with the large pieces
on top. Lay pieces of hardwood or a shovelful of coal on top of the
kindling, building so as to admit of the free circulation of air.
If the stove is to be polished, rub it with blacking. Light the
paper from below. When the fire begins to burn briskly, add coal or
wood: then add more when that kindles. When the fire is well
started and blue flame is no longer seen (about ten minutes), close
the oven damper. Close the creative damper when the fire is
sufficiently hot. Brush the stove and the floor beneath it as soon
as the fire is started. Polish the stove. If the fire becomes too
hot, open the check damper. Fill the tea-kettle with fresh water
and set it on the front of the range.</p>

<p><i>Care of the sink, wash-basin, and garbage pail.</i>&mdash;A
neglected sink or garbage pail may be a fruitful source of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg009" id="pg009">009</a></span>disease,
in addition to attracting water-bugs and other pests. Scraps should
never be left in the sink. After washing the dishes it should be
thoroughly cleaned, a brush and scouring material being used. The
nickel part may be washed with hot soap-suds, wiped dry, and
polished. Water should never be left in the wash-basin. Both the
soap-dish and the wash-basin should be scoured daily. The garbage
pail should be emptied and washed every day, and carefully scalded
once or twice a week.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It will be well to have this lesson succeed or follow a cooking
lesson, for then the pupils will have a keener interest in the
problems of the kitchen. (See Twenty Lessons in Cooking, Lesson
I.)</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>

<p>Cleanliness and order are the two points to be considered in
this lesson. The doing well of each simple household task and the
thoughtful arrangement and planning of all parts of the house
should be emphasized as being of great importance to the
housekeeper's success.</p>

<p>Begin the lesson with a discussion of the purpose of the
kitchen; then discuss its arrangement from the standpoint of
convenience for the work that must be done there. Emphasize the
importance of having the furniture so arranged that the work may be
done quickly and easily, and that the kitchen may be given a
comfortable and attractive appearance. Let the pupils arrange the
furniture in the school-room. Discuss and demonstrate the care of
the stove by the use of the school stove. Assign each pupil a time
when she is to look after the stove on succeeding days and grade
her on her work. Let each pupil bring a report from <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg010" id="pg010">010</a></span>home as to what
she is doing to help in the care of the home kitchen. Make a
specific assignment for home work.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON II: CARE OF CUPBOARDS AND UTENSILS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT-MATTER</h5>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that cupboards and other places
where food is stored should be kept free from dirt and scraps of
food. Ants, cockroaches, mice, and other pests infest dirty places
where food is kept, and render a house unfit for human habitation.
It requires constant care and watchfulness on the part of the
housewife to keep the cupboards clean. She must look over the
shelves daily, wiping them off whenever they need it, and giving
them a thorough cleaning at least once a week.</p>

<p>The housekeeper should know how to care for the various utensils
used and understand the simplest and best methods of keeping them
clean. Utensils should never be put in the cupboards until
perfectly clean and dry. Particular attention should be paid to the
care of milk vessels. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg011" id=
"pg011">011</a></span>Pans, pails, pitchers, or bottles in which
milk has been kept, should be rinsed in cold water, washed in
strong, clean soap-suds, rinsed in clean, boiling water, and dried
in the sun. If utensils have become discoloured or badly coated,
they should be specially scoured. If something has been burned in a
kettle, the kettle should be cleaned by filling with cold water,
adding washing-soda, and boiling briskly for half an hour; after
that a slight scraping ought to remove the burned portion. If the
kettle is not yet clean, the process should be repeated. If a
kettle has been used directly over a wood fire and becomes
blackened with soot, it should be rubbed off with a newspaper and
then with an old cloth. Kettles should be dried well before being
put away. With proper care they seldom become rusty. If an iron
kettle has rusted, it should be rubbed with kerosene and ashes,
then washed in strong, hot, soda-water, rinsed in clear hot water,
and dried on the stove. If a kettle is very rusty, it should be
covered thoroughly with some sort of grease, sprinkled with lime,
and left overnight. In the morning it should be washed out with hot
soda-water and rinsed in clear, hot water. A new kettle is
generally rusty, and should be greased thoroughly inside and out
and allowed to stand for two days; then washed in hot
soda-water.</p>

<p>Bath-brick should be used for scouring iron utensils and steel
knives and forks. If iron pots and frying-pans are scrubbed with a
piece of bath-brick each time they are used and then washed in hot
soap-suds, they can be kept in good condition. Tinware and steel
knives and forks may be cleaned by scouring with ashes, but only
fine ashes should be used on tinware. The brown stains on granite
utensils should be scoured off; and this ware should be carefully
handled, in order to avoid chipping. Coffee-pots <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg012" id="pg012">012</a></span>and tea-pots
should be cleaned daily, the grounds removed, and the interior of
the pots washed out thoroughly. The tea-kettle should be washed and
dried overnight and left uncovered to air.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>If school lunches are served or cooking lessons are given at the
school, it will be well to use this lesson to get the cupboards in
readiness. If it is impossible to do this at school, arrange to
have such a lesson in one of the homes outside of school hours. Be
sure that the housekeeper is in sympathy with the work and is
willing to co-operate.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Assign each pupil a task in the cleaning, the scouring of the
dishes, and the arrangement of the cupboard. Set a definite amount
to be done and carry out the plans, leaving a clean and neatly
arranged cupboard at the end of the lesson.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON III: CARE OF FOODS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Several important points must be borne in mind if foods are to
be kept in a good condition. Most foods change easily. Vegetables
and fruits lose water, wilt, and become unfit to eat. Flour and
corn-meal become mouldy. Potatoes decay and sprout. Some foods, such
as milk, turn sour. Eggs become tainted, and fat grows rancid. With
proper care in handling, storing, and keeping, this spoiling can be
prevented.</p>

<p>The spoiling of foods is due to the presence of micro-organisms;
and if foods are fresh and sound and kept cool <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span>and clean in
every way, they will not spoil readily, because such conditions are
unfavourable to the development of the micro-organisms. On the
other hand, if foods are roughly handled and bruised, decomposition
will take place readily, for micro-organisms develop in the bruised
portions. Care must, therefore, be taken to select foods wisely,
handle them carefully, wash them if they are not already clean, put
them in clean receptacles, and keep them in a clean, cool place.
All pots, pans, and dishes in which foods are kept or cooked should
be thoroughly cleansed and rinsed well, so that no fragments stick
to them which may decay and cause possible infection to the next
food that is put in. Every part of the kitchen and store-rooms
should be kept clean, dry, and well aired. Light is the best
germicide and purifier known.</p>

<p>Covered receptacles should be secured for all foods. Those that
are mouse-proof and insect-proof are essential to a well-kept
pantry. All bottles and cans should be neatly labelled and so
arranged that each one can be conveniently reached. The outside of
the bottle or case should always be wiped off after it has been
opened and food has been removed from it. The shelves on which the
cases are kept should be wiped off every day. If supplies of fruit
or vegetables are kept on hand, they should be looked over
frequently, and whatever shows even the slightest suggestion of
spoiling should be removed. Bread should be kept in a covered tin
box, and the box should be washed out once or twice a week and
frequently scalded and aired.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>If cooking lessons are to be given, it will be well to take this
lesson on the care of foods in connection with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg014" id="pg014">014</a></span>the first
cooking lesson, and to make it a means of arranging for the
materials that are to be kept on hand and of determining how
everything is to be handled.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Devote a large part of the lesson to a discussion of the
necessity for care in the handling, storing, and keeping of foods.
If facilities permit, devote a few minutes to the putting away of
foods that are to be used in the next cooking lesson or in the
school lunch, discussing the reasons for such care.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON IV: DISPOSAL OF WASTE</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>If the daily disposal of waste is attended to, there will be no
undesirable accumulation of garbage. Scraps of food that cannot be
utilized for the table should be fed to the pigs or the chickens
and should not be allowed to stand and gather flies. A covered pail
or pan should be used for holding the garbage, until final disposal
is made of it. Those portions that are badly spoiled and will be of
no value in feeding the stock should be burned at once. Waste
vegetable substances, if suitable, should be fed to the stock, and
if not, should be buried in a thin layer on the ground at some
distance from the house, so that they may enrich the soil.</p>

<p>Old papers that are badly soiled should be burned, but all
others should be kept for use in cleaning the stove, starting the
fires, etc. Empty cans should be well washed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg015" id="pg015">015</a></span>and buried, so
that they will not prove a breeding-place for flies. It is well to
pierce them through the bottom immediately after opening them, so
that they will not hold water. Dish-water should be emptied at some
distance from the house, unless there is a drain nearby. All
receptacles that hold water should be carefully emptied, and all
depressions in the soil should be filled, in order to prevent
mosquitoes from breeding. All waste water should be used on the
garden.</p>

<p><i>Protection of the water supply.</i>&mdash;Only the water from
deep wells should be used for drinking purposes, because all
surface water and water in shallow wells becomes dangerous through
seepage from compost, pig-pens, privies, and other places where
decayed organic matter may accumulate. In order that the water may
be kept clean, the well must be supplied with a tight-fitting top
which need not be opened and a metal pump to bring up the water. A
well platform that allows the water spilled on it to run back into
the well is unsafe, for any filth carried on the platform in any
way will be washed directly into it. Rats, mice, and other animals
get into the well if the top is not tight, and these, in addition
to being unpleasant, are liable to introduce disease germs.</p>

<p><i>Simple disinfectants.</i>&mdash;Sunshine and fresh air are
nature's disinfectants and should be freely admitted to every part
of the house. Windows should be left open whenever possible. The
windows in the sleeping rooms should always be opened at night. The
interior of the house should be kept perfectly dry. Decay does not
easily take place in dry places. A damp cellar should be drained,
and the grounds around the house should not be allowed to drain
into the cellar. Coarse coal ashes should be used to fill in around
the house, on the walks, etc., to help in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg016" id="pg016">016</a></span>securing thorough drainage.
Wood ashes may be used as a simple disinfectant to cover decayed
organic matter. Whitewash is a good disinfectant and should be
frequently used both inside and outside the house and on all
out-buildings. Kerosene and creosote also make good
disinfectants.</p>

<p><i>Care of out-of-door closets.</i>&mdash;The privy should be so
arranged that it may be cleaned often and all excreta disposed of
in a safe way. The building should be so well constructed that
there will be no cracks for the admission of flies. In a poorly
constructed building, old paper can be pasted over the cracks, to
make the structure fly-proof. Dry earth, street dust, or lime
should be frequently sprinkled over the excreta, and the seat
should be closed, to prevent the entrance of flies or mosquitoes.
The seat should be washed frequently, and both the seat and the
floor scrubbed at least once a week.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It will be well to teach this lesson at a time when improvements
are necessary in the care of the school-house. The discussions in
regard to out-of-door closets will, of course, be taken when the
girls are alone with the teacher.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss the disposal of waste, the care of garbage, etc., in the
home and the school. Talk over the care of waste from the school
lunch and discuss methods of keeping the school in a sanitary
condition. Follow this by a general cleaning of the
school-house.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg017" id=

<div class="blockquot">Melt the fat slowly. Mix the lye and water
in a bowl or kettle (do not use a tin pan), stirring with a stick
until the potash dissolves. Add the borax and allow the mixture to
cool. Cool the fat and, when it is lukewarm, add the lye, pouring
it in a thin stream and stirring constantly. Stir with a smooth
stick until about as thick as honey, and continue stirring for ten
minutes. Pour the mixture into a box and allow it to harden. Cut
into pieces the desired size and leave in a cool, dry place for ten
days, to ripen before using.</div>

<div class="blockquot">When making the soap, be careful not to
spill potash or lye on the hands, as it makes a bad burn. If the
hands are burned, rub them with grease at once. Do not wet
them.</div>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Some time before this lesson is given ask the pupils to bring
scraps of fat from home. See that these are in good condition, and
weigh them, to determine the portion of the recipe that can be
made. Ask one of the pupils to bring sufficient borax for the
recipe.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Let the pupils look the fat over and put it on to melt, watching
it carefully. While it is heating and cooling, discuss the process
of soap-making, the cost of materials, the care necessary in the
making of soap, and the importance of its use. Get ready the other
materials, and a box for moulding the soap, and let the pupils work
together. After the soap has hardened and been cut, have it put
away on a shelf to dry.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg018" id=
"pg018">018</a></span>LESSON VI: SETTING AND CLEARING THE
TABLE</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>The following points must be remembered when a meal is to be
served: The dining-room must be clean, well aired, sufficiently
lighted, and in good order.</p>

<p>The table must be perfectly clean and covered with a clean white
cover (table-cloth, doilies, paper napkins, or oil-cloth).</p>

<p>A vase of flowers or leaves or a small potted plant, in the
centre of the table, will help to make it attractive.</p>

<p>The table should be prepared with everything necessary for
serving the meal, but only those foods should be placed on it that
will not be spoiled by standing. If there is danger of the food
attracting flies, cover it carefully.</p>

<p>Plates for everyone who is to partake of the meal should be
arranged at equal distances from one another, and half an inch from
the edge of the table.</p>

<p>The knife should be placed at the right of the plate with the
cutting edge toward the plate, and one inch from the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>The fork should be placed at the left of the plate with the
tines turned up, and one inch from the edge of the table.</p>

<p>The spoon should be placed, bowl upward, at the right of the
plate, to the right of the knife. It should be placed one inch from
the edge of the table. Spoons and forks for serving should be
placed at the right and left of the dish to be served, or in
another convenient position. No one should have to use the personal
fork or spoon for serving.</p>

<p>The napkins should be folded simply and placed at the left of
the fork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg019" id=
"pg019">019</a></span>The tumbler should be placed at the upper end
of the knife.</p>

<p>The cups and saucers should be placed at the right of the plate
with the handle of the cup toward the right.</p>

<p>The bread-and-butter plate, if used, should be placed at the
upper left hand of the fork.</p>

<p>The salt-cellars and pepper-shakers should be placed near the
centre of the table or at the sides, where they can be conveniently
reached. Individual salt-cellars, if used, should be placed
immediately in front of the individual plate.</p>

<p>The chairs should be placed at the table after it is set. Care
should be taken not to put them so close to it that it will be
necessary to move them after they are occupied.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>If possible, arrange to give this lesson before Lesson VIII in
the series of "Twenty Lessons in Cooking" is given; then the
emphasis in that lesson may be put upon the food to be served,
proper combinations, etc., while this lesson gives the drill in the
arrangement and handling of the dishes.</p>

<p>It is desirable to give the pupils a thorough drill in table
setting and table service, since much of the pleasure derived from
eating depends upon the attention paid to these processes.</p>

<p>Be careful to see that everything necessary is on hand to set
the table simply but daintily. For class practice a small table may
be set for four. This will necessitate a table-cover, four or more
dinner plates, four bread-and-butter plates, four tumblers, four
cups and saucers, four knives, four forks, four teaspoons, four
napkins, a saltcellar, a pepper-shaker, a platter, one serving
spoon, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg020" id=
"pg020">020</a></span>one serving fork. If these things are not
already in the school, probably they can be brought from home by
the pupils. If linen cloths are not used and cannot be afforded on
the tables in the homes, the pupils should be taught to use a white
oil-cloth.</p>

<p>Have a diagram made on the black-board by one of the pupils of
the arrangement of an individual place at the table.</p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The process of table setting should be demonstrated with the
materials at hand, and the work should be adapted to home
conditions.</p>

<p>If there is no available table in the school-room, the desk tops
may be used for individual places.</p>

<p>Reasons for the arrangement of the table should be
given&mdash;the convenience of placing the knives and the spoons to
the right, the forks to the left, the cup and saucer and the
tumbler to the right, the use of the napkin, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg021" id=
"pg021">021</a></span></p>

<div class="center">LESSON VII: WAITING ON TABLE</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>The one who is to wait on table must be careful to see that
everything is in readiness before the meal is announced, so that
she can do her work easily, without subjecting those at the table
to unnecessary delay. She should have water, bread, and butter (if
used), hot dishes ready for the hot foods, and dessert dishes
conveniently at hand. She must see that her hands are perfectly
clean and her hair and dress in order. A clean, neat apron will
always improve her appearance. The room should be clean and neatly
arranged.</p>

<p>If the meal is to be a family one and all are to sit at the
table together, plates will be passed from one to another as they
are served: but it will still be well to have one person appointed
to wait on the table. She should be ready to supply more bread,
water, etc., when it is necessary, and to change the plates for the
dessert course. She should rise from the table quickly and quietly,
in order not to disturb others, and should take her place again as
soon as the necessary service has been rendered.</p>

<p>The following rules should be observed: Hold the tumblers near
the bottom, being careful not to touch the upper edge. Fill only
three-quarters full.</p>

<p>Put the butter on the table just before the meal is announced,
and serve in neat, compact pieces.</p>

<p>Cut the bread in even slices, pile them neatly on a serving
plate, and place it on the table, covering it with a clean napkin
or towel, if there are flies about or there is danger of dust. If
preferred, the bread may be cut at the table as required. Place the
dessert dishes at one end of the table or, better still, on a side
table, until it is time to use <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg022" id="pg022">022</a></span>them. When carrying the dishes to
and from the table, be careful not to let the fingers come in
contact with the food. Learn to place the hand under the dish. In
particular service a napkin is used between the hand and the dish,
or a tray, if the dish is a small one. The tray should be covered
with a napkin or doily.</p>

<p>When a dish is being passed, hold it at the left of the person
to be served and at a convenient height and distance. Be sure that
each dish is supplied with a spoon or a fork for serving, and turn
the handle of the spoon or the fork toward the one to be
served.</p>

<p>If a plate is to be placed in front of a person, set it down
from the right. Never reach in front of others at the table.</p>

<p>When a course is finished, remove the dishes containing the food
first; then the soiled plates, knives, and forks. Be careful to
handle only a few dishes at a time and not to pile them. If another
course is to be served, remove the crumbs from the table, using for
the purpose a napkin and plate, or a crumb tray and brush, and
brushing the crumbs lightly into the plate. Fill the tumblers, and
arrange the dishes and forks or spoons quickly for the next
course.</p>

<p>When the meal is over, the chairs should be moved back from the
table, the dishes neatly piled and carried to the kitchen sink, the
table wiped, the crumbs brushed from the floor, and the room
aired.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Let this lesson be a continuation of the previous one, placing
emphasis on the method of waiting on table. The same articles will
be required as were used in the last lesson. In addition to these
the pupils must be careful to have clean aprons for this
lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg023" id=
"pg023">023</a></span></p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Have the table set, as a review of the work of the last lesson;
then have four or six of the pupils seat themselves and go through
the forms of serving one another to any simple meal upon which the
class may decide. Family meal service should be explained and
demonstrated first; then service where there is one waitress. Have
the pupils, in turn, act as waitresses and serve all the others,
offering and placing the food, removing the soiled dishes, filling
the tumblers, etc.</p>

<div class="center">LESSONS VIII AND IX: GENERAL CLEANING OF A
ROOM</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Rooms which are in constant use should be swept and dusted every
day. A thorough cleaning of each room in the house will be
necessary every week or two, even though the room is swept and kept
in order daily. First, all cupboards, drawers, and other
receptacles in which articles collect should be cleaned; then all
large movable articles should be dusted and moved out of the room;
those that are not readily movable should be dusted and covered.
The floor should be swept with the windows open; the ceiling and
walls should be brushed with a covered broom, and the dust allowed
to settle. The floor should then be wiped with a damp cloth on the
broom.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The wood-work should be <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg024" id="pg024">024</a></span>cleaned
with a damp cloth and a soap that is not too strong. Soda or
sapolio should not be used. The furniture should be carefully
uncovered, and everything arranged in perfect order.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> If the floor is of
unfinished-wood, it will require a thorough scrubbing. After
sweeping the floor and allowing the dust to settle, a small portion
at a time should be scrubbed with a floor-brush and soap. When
scrubbing, the grain of the wood should be followed. The
scrubbing-water should be changed frequently. For rinsing and
drying the floor, a cloth should be wrung out of clear water.</p>
</div>

<p>The things that are highest should be dusted first, and care
should be taken to collect all the dust in the dust-cloth. After
collecting the dust, the cloth should be shaken out-of-doors,
washed thoroughly, and boiled. The dust-cloth should be dampened
before using on all surfaces except the polished furniture and
windows.</p>

<p>Sweeping should be done with short strokes and the broom should
be kept close to the floor, so that the dust will not be scattered.
The corners of the room should be swept first, the dust gathered in
the centre, and then swept into the dust-pan. The dust should be
burned, for it may contain disease germs. Loose hairs and fluff
should be removed from the broom after using, and it should also be
washed periodically.</p>

<p>Small rugs should be cleaned out-of-doors. They should be swept,
beaten, and re-swept, then rolled until ready to be put on the
floor. If the rug is a large one and cannot be removed, it should
be wiped over with a damp cloth, rolled, and the under side of the
rug and the floor beneath it should be wiped.</p>

<p>After the room has been cleaned, the windows should be arranged
so that a supply of fresh, clean air can come constantly into it.
This is essential to every room in the house, if perfect health is
to be maintained.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It will be well to have Lesson IX given in one of the homes some
day after school hours, if possible. If that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg025" id="pg025">025</a></span>cannot be
arranged, the school-room may be utilized as the place for
practice.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Devote Lesson VIII to a discussion of the methods of cleaning
and to various short tasks in connection with the school-room. In
Lesson IX have the pupils go through the entire process of cleaning
a room. Assign some portion of the task to each one of them, so
that all may take part in the work. Supervise the work carefully,
assign home practice, and have each pupil clean a room at home once
a week for a month.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON X: CARE OF THE BED-ROOM</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>As soon as one is dressed in the morning, the windows in the
bed-room should be opened wide to air the room thoroughly, and the
bed-clothes should be removed and put on chairs before the window
to air. The night clothing should also be aired. The slops should
be emptied, and the chamber should be washed with cold water, using
a special cloth. The basin should be washed in warm, soapy water,
which should then be poured into the chamber and used for washing
it. The toilet articles should be washed, then the basin rinsed and
wiped dry. The slop jar should be washed out thoroughly, and both
the slop jar and the chamber should be cleaned frequently with
chloride of lime or some other disinfectant. The pitcher should be
filled with fresh water, and all the articles arranged neatly on
the wash-stand. If the towels are soiled, clean ones should be
supplied. The mattress should be turned <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg026" id="pg026">026</a></span>and the bed made carefully;
the lower sheet being tucked under the mattress all around, and the
other covers tucked in at the bottom and sides of the bed. The bed
should be kept free from wrinkles and smooth in appearance, and the
pillows should be well shaken and arranged at the head of the bed.
The floor should be swept, the furniture dusted, and everything put
in place. The windows should be left partly opened, so that the
bed-room may be well aired. Fresh air is always necessary, but
especially during sleep, when the body is repairing itself, and it
is important that the room should be well aired during the day and
the windows left open at night.</p>

<p>When the room is to be thoroughly cleaned, the frame of the bed
should be dusted, the mattress turned, and the bed should be made.
The window shades should be dusted and rolled up. The curtains
should be well shaken and covered, if one has a dust sheet. All the
small articles on the bureau, table, and shelf should be placed on
the bed, and the whole covered with a sheet. The tables, chairs,
and any other movable furniture should be dusted and placed outside
the room or covered. The rugs should be rolled and cleaned
out-of-doors. The room should be swept and dusted. As soon as the
dust has settled, the covers should be removed, and the furniture,
rugs, and all the small articles should be restored to their
places. The shades should be adjusted, and the room left in perfect
order. The broom and everything else that has been used in the work
should be cleaned and put back into their places.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It may be possible for the teacher to give this lesson in her
own bed-room or in the bed-room of one of the neighbours. If this
is not feasible, the only way to make <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg027" id="pg027">027</a></span>it effective is to have the
pupils report each day on the work they do at home.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Illustrate each process and give the reasons for everything that
is done. Emphasize the importance of the sanitary care of the
bed-room, a regular time for doing the work, and the benefit of
having each member of the family care for her own personal
belongings and her own portion of the bed-room.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XI: CARE OF LAMPS</div>

<div class="blockquot">It is assumed that the teacher is acquainted
with the possibilities of electricity and other methods of better
lighting in country homes, and will instruct her pupils in the
economic use of modern lighting facilities.</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Directions for cleaning and filling lamps.</i>&mdash;A bright
light comes from clean burners that allow a good draught. This
means constant care on the part of the one who looks after the
lamps. In the daily cleaning, first dust the chimney shade and the
body of the lamp. Wash the chimney. If sooty, clean with a
newspaper before washing. Next, turn the wick high enough to show
all the charred part; cut this off, making it perfectly even, then
rub with a piece of soft paper. Wipe the burner and any other part
of the lamp that may be oily. Dry with another cloth. Fill the body
of the lamp with oil to within an inch of the top, leaving plenty
of room for the gas that may be generated from the kerosene, as
this gas, in a lamp that has been used many times without
refilling, may be a source of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028" id=
"pg028">028</a></span>When lighting the lamp, turn the wick down,
allowing the chimney to become heated gradually. If it is necessary
to move the lighted lamp, turn the wick low. The flaring up of the
flame smokes the chimney. Do not leave a lighted lamp in a room
where there is no one to watch it. When putting out the light, blow
across the chimney, never down into it, as this might send the
flame down into the kerosene.</p>

<p>About once a month give the lamp a thorough cleaning. Spread out
a newspaper and take the lamp apart. Wash the chimney and the shade
in hot water, dry with a towel, and polish, using soft paper. Boil
every part of the burner in water to which two tablespoonfuls of
soda have been added. Insert new wicks if the old ones are dirty,
and put the parts all securely together again. Keep an old pan and
some cloths exclusively for this purpose, and be very careful not
to allow the dirty hands or a drop of kerosene to come near any
food.</p>

<p>Have a regular time in the day for cleaning the lamps,
preferably immediately after all the morning work has been done
after breakfast. Do not fill the lamps near the kitchen stove. Do
not light a match while the oil-can is near, and never fill a lamp
while it is lighted or while near another one which is lighted. If
a fire is caused by kerosene, smother it with a heavy rug or a
woollen garment, and do not attempt to put it out with water.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It will be well to give this lesson just before some evening
entertainment at the school-house. If there are no lamps at the
school have a few brought in from neighbouring homes. Secure an old
pan and some cloths to use in cleaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg029" id=
"pg029">029</a></span></p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss with the pupils the cost and properties of kerosene and
the danger of having a light or too great heat near a can of
kerosene. Explain the draught by means of which the kerosene can be
made to burn on the wick and the danger if the burner becomes
clogged up and the draught is cut off. Have the lamps taken apart,
the burners boiled, the chimneys cleaned, and the body of the lamps
filled and wiped off. Then have the lamps lighted, to see that they
burn properly.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XII: PREVENTION OF PESTS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Household pests are annoying, dangerous to health, and
destructive to property. They carry disease germs from one person
to another and from the lower animals to human beings. Absolute
cleanliness is essential, if the house is to be kept free from
pests. As a rule, they flourish in dark, damp, dirty places. With
proper care the housekeeper can keep her house free from them and,
if they are noticed, she should know how to exterminate them.</p>

<p>A few simple methods of extermination are here given:</p>

<p><i>Bedbugs.</i>&mdash;Kerosene should be poured into all the
cracks, and a brush, dipped in kerosene, run briskly over all
surfaces. Care must be taken to have no fire in the room while this
is being done. The windows should be open, and the room should be
kept free from dust. In four days this should be repeated, in order
to kill any bugs that may have just hatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg030" id=
"pg030">030</a></span><i>Cockroaches and water-bugs.</i>&mdash;A
solution of one pound of alum to three pints of water should be
poured into all the cracks. Insect-powder and borax are also
effective. Absolute cleanliness and freedom from dampness are
necessary, if the house is to be kept free from cockroaches.</p>

<p><i>Ants.</i>&mdash;Oil of cloves or pennyroyal on pieces of
cotton-batting scattered about in the places where ants appear will
drive them away. Saturating the nests with coal-oil will destroy
them. Food which attracts ants should be removed from places which
they are able to reach.</p>

<p><i>Rats and mice.</i>&mdash;These are best exterminated by the
use of a trap or some preparation such as "Rough on Rats". Traps
should be set nightly and should be scalded and aired after a mouse
has been caught. Rat holes may be stopped by sprinkling with
chloride of lime and then filling with mortar or plaster of
Paris.</p>

<p><i>Mosquitoes.</i>&mdash;These breed in swampy places, or in old
barrels or kegs or tin cans which hold stagnant water. Therefore,
if the swampy places are drained and the grounds about the house
are kept free from stagnant water, the housekeeper will, as a rule,
not be troubled with mosquitoes. Empty barrels or kegs should be
inverted, and old tin cans should have a hole punched in the
bottom, so that they will not hold water. All high weeds near the
house should be cut down and destroyed, so that they will not
provide a damp place in which to harbour mosquitoes. If it is
impossible to get rid of all standing water, the breeding of
mosquitoes can be checked by pouring kerosene oil on the water. One
ounce of oil on fifteen square feet of water is sufficient, and
this will have to be renewed at least once in ten days. The doors,
windows, and ventilators of the house should be well screened, as a
protection against mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg031" id=
"pg031">031</a></span><i>Flies.</i>&mdash;These are one of the
greatest carriers of typhoid and other germs, as well as filth of
all sorts. They can be got rid of only by destroying the breeding
places and killing the flies as rapidly as possible. Materials that
attract them should not be exposed in and about the house. The
house should be well screened with wire mesh or mosquito netting,
in order to keep out the flies. A fly swatter should be kept at
hand. The stables should be cleaned daily. Manure piles should be
screened, and every effort should be made to kill the larv&aelig;
by frequent spraying with kerosene, creoline (dilute creosote), or
lime.</p>

<p><i>Fleas.</i>&mdash;These will be troublesome if cats or dogs
are kept in the house. These pets should be given frequent baths,
the rugs on which they lie should be brushed and shaken daily, and
the floors should be washed with soap and water and wiped with
kerosene.</p>

<p><i>Moths.</i>&mdash;These are apt to develop in woollen clothes
unless the garments are thoroughly shaken and absolutely protected
by wrapping in newspapers before being put away. Woollen garments
that are used only occasionally should be kept in a light, dry
place, examined frequently, and hung in the sun occasionally. Moths
or carpet beetles can be exterminated by the use of kerosene.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Give this lesson at a time when the pupils are asking about
household pests or when the school is suffering from them. It would
be well to have it in the spring, just before the school closes, so
that the pupils may immediately put into practice what they learn.
It may be desirable to devote their efforts to the destruction of
one particular pest; for example, a fly crusade may be
inaugurated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg032" id=
"pg032">032</a></span></p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>If there are pests in the school-room, discuss their habits,
what seems to attract them, where they come from, etc. Have the
pupils report any that they may have at home. Explain why they are
dangerous, tell how they can be exterminated, and assign to each
pupil the task of exterminating one household pest. Have her
report, each day, the success of her efforts. Continue this work
for several weeks.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XIII: REMOVING STAINS, BLEACHING
FABRICS, AND SETTING COLOURS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>As garments and household linens are apt to become stained and
thus lose their attractiveness, it is well to know the remedies for
the most common stains and the principle upon which their removal
depends. All stains should be removed as soon as possible. Boiling
water will loosen and remove coffee, tea, and fresh fruit stains.
The stained spot should be held over a bowl, and the water should
be poured upon it with some force. Cold water will remove stains
made by blood or meat juice. Soaking will help in the removal of
blood stains. Rust stains may be removed by wetting the stained
spot with lemon juice, covering it with salt, and placing the
stained fabric in the sun. Stains from stove blacking, paint, and
grass may be removed by soaking in kerosene and washing well with
soap and water. Ink stains may be removed by soaking in water,
removing as much of the stain as possible, and then soaking in
milk. Stains from cream and other forms of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg033" id="pg033">033</a></span>grease may be washed out in
cold water, followed by warm water and soap.</p>

<p>White cotton and white linen materials may be bleached by
exposure to the sunshine while still damp. If they are left out
overnight, the bleaching process is made effective by the moisture
furnished by dew or frost. A stream of steam from the tea-kettle
may also help in the bleaching process.</p>

<p>Some colours are set by the addition of a small amount of acid
to the first water in which they are soaked, while others are set
by the use of salt. It is necessary to try a small amount of the
material before dipping in the entire garment, in order to be sure
of satisfactory results. Vinegar should be used for blues, one-half
cup to one gallon of water. Salt is most effective for browns,
blacks, and pinks. In most cases, two cups of salt to one gallon of
cold water will be sufficient.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The towels used for drying dishes or the linen used for some
school entertainment may have become stained with coffee, fruit, or
some other substance. Make this the basis of a lesson, and let the
pupils bring from home other things which are stained. Each pupil
should have an article on which to practise. This lesson should be
preliminary to the lesson on laundry work.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Examine the various articles from which stains are to be
removed. Discuss the method of removal, and let each pupil work at
her own stain until it is as nearly removed as possible.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg034" id=
"pg034">034</a></span>LESSON XIV: WASHING DISH-TOWELS, APRONS,
ETC.</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Dish-towels should be thoroughly washed at least once a day.
Wash one piece at a time (the cleanest first) in warm, soapy water
and rinse in clear water in another pan. Hang in the sun, if
possible, so that the air will pass through. Boil at least once a
week in soapy water, to keep them fresh and white. Sunshine and
fresh air are valuable for the purposes of bleaching and
purifying.</p>

<p>Wash the aprons in hot, soapy water; boil, rinse, and blue
slightly. A small amount of thin starch may be desirable. A thin
starch may be made as follows:</p>

<div class="center2"><i>Recipe for Thin Starch</i></div>

<table width="95%" summary="Recipe for Thin Starch" border="0">
<tr>
<td class="cell_list6b">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="cell_list3c">

</table>

<div class="blockquot">Add the cold water to the starch and lard,
stir until smooth, then add the boiling water slowly, stirring
constantly. Boil for several minutes in order to cook the starch
thoroughly; then add one pint of cold water and a small amount of
blueing. Dilute if necessary.</div>

<p>Hang the articles in the sun to dry, shaking well before putting
on the line, and folding the edge of each over at least six inches.
Be sure to have the line clean. When dry, fold carefully. A short
time before ironing, sprinkle well.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It may be desirable to give this lesson earlier in the course,
if cooking lessons are being given and dish-towels <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg035" id="pg035">035</a></span>are in use, or
if the aprons are badly soiled. Other articles may be washed, if
time and facilities permit.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss briefly the need for laundry work and the general
principles. Let the pupils take turns at washing the towels or
aprons; examine each article after it is washed, and give careful
directions for the boiling, blueing, and starching. While these
processes are being completed, let some of the pupils prepare the
line. Let two of them be appointed to bring the towels in, before
going home from school.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XV: IRONING</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>To do good ironing it is necessary to have a firm, unwarped
ironing board. This should be covered with some thick woollen
material and a white cotton cover that is clean, smooth, and
tightly drawn. The thick cover should be tacked on, while the top
cover should be pinned, so that it may be easily taken off to be
washed. A heavy iron-holder should be provided; and the irons
should be clean and smooth. For this purpose paper should be kept
at hand, as well as a piece of beeswax, sandpaper, or salt. A small
cloth should be used to wipe the iron after using the beeswax. A
newspaper should be spread on the floor, to protect any pieces that
may hang down while being ironed. The coarser towels should be
ironed first, as the longer the irons are used, the smoother they
become. Starched pieces should not be ironed until the irons are
very hot. If the article is first laid smooth, it will be easier to
iron it and keep it in <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg036" id=
"pg036">036</a></span>shape, and every piece should be ironed until
it is perfectly dry. As soon as the ironing is completed, the
articles should be hung up to air.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Arrange to have the ironing lesson just as soon after the
laundry lesson as possible. It will probably be easy to borrow the
necessary equipment from homes near the school. Each pupil may be
directed to bring something that will contribute toward the
equipment, and one may be instructed to have the fire ready and
another to put the irons on to heat before the lesson hour.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Call the pupils together early in the morning or at some time
previous to the lesson period, and give them directions for
sprinkling the articles to be ironed. When the class hour comes,
demonstrate the method of ironing, folding, and hanging the
articles, and let the pupils take turns in doing the work.</p>

<div class="center">LESSONS XVI AND XVII: CARE OF THE BABY</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Because young girls are fond of little children and must help
their mothers often with their baby brothers and sisters, they
should know how to care for them. It is essential that they should
understand the following points: The little body needs protection.
The head is soft, and the brain may be injured by hard bumps or
pressure. The skin is tender and is easily irritated by the bites
of insects, friction, and so on. Kicking and wiggling are necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pg037" id="pg037">037</a></span>to
the development of the muscles, but the baby should not be played
with all the time; and it is well for it while awake to lie quiet
for part of the time. It should not be made to sit up until ready
to do so. A desire to creep should be encouraged. Standing or
walking should not be taught the baby until it tries to stand or
walk itself, and then it must be helped very carefully.</p>

<p>The baby should have plenty of fresh air and should be allowed
to spend much of its time out-of-doors. In cold weather it must be
warmly covered and sheltered from high winds. Its eyes should
always be protected from strong sunlight.</p>

<p>Regular hours should be observed for sleep, and the baby should
be put to bed early in the evening. If the house is not well
screened in summer, a mosquito bar should be put over the crib. The
clothing should be light and loose, so that the body can move
freely.</p>

<p>Perfect cleanliness is necessary to keep the baby's skin in good
condition; and a daily bath should be given. A morning hour, midway
between the meals, is usually the best time for this. The baby
should be taught to use the chamber before the bath and after the
nap. Everything should be ready before it is undressed. The room
should be very warm. The water should be only moderately warm, and
should be carefully tested to make sure that it is not too hot. The
towels and covers for the baby should be at hand. The head and the
feet should be washed first, and the body soaped before putting the
child into the bath. Little soap should be used, for even the best
soap is strong and is apt to irritate the delicate skin. The bath
should be given quickly, and the body wrapped at once in a blanket
or towel and kept covered as much as possible while it is being
dried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg038" id=
"pg038">038</a></span>The baby should be fed in small quantities at
regular intervals and given plenty of cold water to drink. Not
until it is eleven or twelve months of age should it be given solid
or semi-solid food. Even then, milk should continue to form the
basis of its diet, and of this a considerable quantity should be
used&mdash;about a quart a day from the twelfth month on. As the
child grows older a more varied diet will be necessary. The most
hygienic methods of food preparation should always be observed.</p>

<p>Certain foods should never be given; for example, fried foods,
pastries, condiments, pickles, preserves, canned meats, fish, pork,
sausage, cheap candies, coarse vegetables, unripe and overripe
fruits, stimulants, foods treated with a preservative or colouring
matter, and half-cooked starches.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should talk with the pupils, in order to see what
points in connection with the care of the baby it is necessary for
them to know, so that they may do their work at home
intelligently.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>It will probably not be possible to have anything more than a
class discussion of the points in question, but the pupils' home
experiences ought to make this discussion vital. If there is a
nurse in the neighbourhood who can be secured to give one lesson on
the care of the baby, the teacher should supplement her own lessons
by an additional lesson given by the nurse.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg039" id=
"pg039">039</a></span>LESSON XVIII: COST OF FOOD, CLOTHING, AND
HOUSE</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>It is of great importance that children should learn in an
elementary way the value of property. This will prepare them for
the knowledge of the cost of living that is essential. They should
learn that the cost of food can be decreased by having gardens, and
by the proper choice, care, and handling of foods; that taking care
of clothing will reduce another item of expense; and that the
owning of one's own house and lot is something worth working for,
in order to obviate the necessity of paying rent.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher will have to acquaint herself thoroughly with
conditions in the community, so that she can talk intelligently
with the pupils, emphasize the right points, and give constructive
help.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Begin with a discussion of the cost of food; how much the pupils
earn or spend during the week; and why it is worth while to cook
and sew well and to look after property. Continue such discussions
from time to time, in connection with other school work.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XIX: HOW TO KEEP ACCOUNTS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>It is well for every one to keep a written record of all money
received and all money spent. Children should be taught to do this
as soon as they are old enough to have <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg040" id="pg040">040</a></span>money in their possession. A
simple little note-book in which all expenditures are entered on
the right side and all receipts on the left side, with the balance
drawn up each week or month, will prove an easy and satisfactory
method of keeping accounts. If the little girl learns to do this
with her pennies, she will be better able to take care of the more
important household accounts when she is in charge of a home.
However, there will be no real incentive for her to keep accounts
unless she is endeavouring to save for some good purpose. If she
learns to save for the future purchase of a book, a dress, or some
little treat, she will feel that her account-keeping is worth
while. As a housekeeper, she will appreciate the importance of
saving for some future benefit to the family.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>In order to make the lesson of vital interest, introduce it at a
time when the pupils are saving for some specific
purpose&mdash;material for a dress to be made in the sewing class,
refreshments for a party for their mothers, a school library, or
something else that will be a pleasure and help in the work of the
school.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>After discussing the sources of income of the pupil and of her
family, and the means of increasing and taking care of that income,
discuss simple methods of keeping accounts, illustrate these on the
black-board, show how to balance the accounts, and see that each
pupil has a small book suitable for the purpose. It may be
necessary to make or to rule this book as a portion of the class
exercise.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg041" id=
"pg041">041</a></span>LESSON XX: CARE OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE
HOUSE</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Closely allied to the housekeeper's work within the home is the
care of the exterior of the house and its surroundings. It is
absolutely necessary that the grounds be kept neat and clean. In
addition to this they should be made attractive by the careful
selection of a few trees and shrubs suitably placed. While the
gardens at the rear of the house may be planned solely for the
pleasure and use of the family, in planning the lawn at the sides
and front the neighbours and passers-by must be considered. The
grounds should be a picture of which the house is the centre, the
trees and shrubs being grouped to frame the picture.</p>

<p>In placing shrubs, the effect of the whole landscape should be
considered. As a rule, shrubs should be placed in corners, to hide
outhouses from view, or to screen other places which should be
shielded. The centre of the lawn should be left free, and in no
case should a shrub be placed in the middle of an open space in a
lawn or yard. A few flowers should be planted among the shrubs, to
give colour at different seasons.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house must be considered, if the picture
framed by the shrubs and vines is to be a pleasing one. The house
should be painted in a soft brown or dark green to blend with the
landscape of oaks and pines. The paint will help to preserve the
house, but its colour must be carefully chosen to give a pleasing
effect.</p>

<p>The general plan of the grounds and local conditions in regard
to soil and climate will determine to a large extent the kind of
shrubs to be used. Many beautiful shrubs which have been introduced
from foreign countries do <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg042" id=
"pg042">042</a></span>well in Ontario, but our native shrubs serve
all decorative purposes. For damp ground there is no better shrub
than the red osier dogwood. This shrub will do well on almost any
kind of soil. The swamp bush honeysuckle grows quickly and is
suitable for clay land; so are the black elderberry and several
species of viburnum. The hazel which may be obtained from the woods
makes a good dense shrub, and the wild rose also has possibilities.
The common barberry is an attractive shrub; but, as it assists in
the formation of wheat rust, it should not be used in rural
sections. The lilac may be used where a high shrub is desirable.
The common arbor vitae or cedar of the swamps makes a good
evergreen shrub. It serves well as a shield for both winter and
summer and thrives with moderate care. The weigela, forsythia, and
spir&aelig;a are also excellent shrubs.</p>

<p>The ground at the back of the house should be used for vegetable
gardens with flower borders. For this purpose a deep, rich soil is
necessary, and every square foot of space should be utilized. Every
family should learn to make use of an increased number of
vegetables and fruits and to cook them in a variety of ways. No
crops should be allowed to go to waste. A family of five people
could be entirely provided with vegetables for the summer and
autumn from a garden less than fifty by seventy-five feet.</p>

<p>The attractiveness, as well as the usefulness, of the borders
depends upon the choice and arrangement of flowers. These should be
chosen with due consideration as to height of plants, colour of
blooms, and seasons of blooming. The tallest plants should be
placed at the back of the border; for a border six feet wide none
of the plants need be over five feet in height. There can be a riot
of colours, if the flowers are arranged in clumps of four to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span>six
throughout the entire length of the border. In a well-planned
flower border some flowers should be in bloom each month. Hardy
perennial flowers should predominate, with enough annuals to fill
up the spaces and hide the soil. The well-tried, old-fashioned
flowers will give the best satisfaction. Every four years the
flower borders need to be spaded, well manured, and replanted.</p>

<p>The following lists of flowers for borders may be
suggestive:</p>

<p><i>Perennials.</i>&mdash;Bleeding-heart, carnations,
chrysanthemums, columbine, coreopsis, dahlias, gaillardias, golden
glow, iris, larkspur, oriental poppies, peonies, phlox, pinks,
platycodon, snapdragon.</p>

<p><i>Biennials.</i>&mdash;Forget-me-not, foxglove, Canterbury
bells, hollyhock, sweet-william, wallflower.</p>

<p><i>Annuals.</i>&mdash;African daisy, ageratum, aster, calendula,
calliopsis, balsam, candytuft, cornflower, cosmos, marigold,
mignonette, nasturtium, petunia, poppy, stock, sweet alyssum,
sweet-pea, verbena, zinnia, annual phlox, red sunflower,
cut-and-come-again sunflower.</p>

<p>Each home gardener should study garden literature, in order to
assist in solving the garden problems; for the day has passed when
one needed only to scratch the soil with a shell, plant the seeds,
and receive an abundant crop. Today successful gardening depends
upon intelligent management of the soil and crop and upon
persistent labour.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should, if possible, visit the homes of all the
pupils, in order to make herself familiar with the condition in
which their grounds are kept. She may be able to secure permission
from one of the housekeepers to use <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg044" id="pg044">044</a></span>her grounds as the practice place
for the lesson, or it may be more desirable to give this lesson at
the school and to conduct a school garden as a model home
garden.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss the arrangement and care of the home or school grounds.
Have the class tidy the lawn and garden chosen for the lesson,
supervising the work carefully. Assign the tidying up of the home
lawns or work in the home gardens for the coming week. Let this
lesson serve as a means of interesting the pupils in home
gardening, if that has not already been taken up, or of emphasizing
the relation of gardening to the housekeeper's work, if they are
already interested in the former.</p>

<h3>TWENTY LESSONS IN COOKING</h3>


<h5>SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER</h5>

<p>The teacher should learn how the pupils live in their own homes,
what food produce is grown for home use, what foods they use, and
how they prepare and serve their foods. The instruction given in
the lessons should be based on this knowledge, and the
possibilities for the improvement of accepted methods of cooking
should be considered. Those foods should be used in the recipes
which the pupils can afford to use at home. They should be
encouraged to grow in their gardens a variety of garden produce,
and to keep chickens, pigs, and cows.</p>

<p>Elementary principles of nutrition and sanitation should be
taught. Simple meals, with plain but well-cooked dishes, should be
planned. Variations should be suggested, and the value of a mixed
diet emphasized. Care should be taken not to waste time on points
that are unrelated to the homes of the pupils, except as such
points may be necessary to raise their ideals.</p>

<p>All the work should be done carefully. The sanitary handling of
food and care in the storage of foods should be insisted upon.
Careful attention should be given to the dish-washing, care of the
dish-towels, etc., emphasizing the points in sanitation involved.
The pupils should be drilled faithfully in all points connected
with the handling of anything that comes in contact with the
food.</p>

<p>Proper methods of sweeping and cleaning should be employed, and
thoroughness must be practised in every detail of the work.
Constant drill in these processes should be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg046" id=
"pg046">046</a></span>The order in which the lessons are to be
given will be regulated, in part, by the season of the year in
which they occur, the locality, the foods obtainable, and any
special local needs. However, care must be taken that the lessons
are given in proper sequence, so that the pupils may see the
relation of one to another and may appreciate the value of each. It
may be necessary to combine two lessons or to give only part of a
lesson. In some of the lessons more recipes are suggested than can
be prepared in a brief period. In every case the choice of a recipe
will have to be made by the teacher. Wherever it is possible,
simple experiments should be performed to show the composition of,
and the effect of heat on, food.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to give a complete set of recipes; but
those included here are chosen as illustrating the subjects to be
discussed in the lessons. The teacher who desires to make use of a
greater number of recipes will do well to supply herself with one
of the text-books listed. Level measurements should be used in the
preparation of all the recipes, and all the directions should be
carefully followed.</p>

<p>The first few lessons are more fully outlined than the others,
furnishing suggestions for methods of procedure that may be adapted
to later lessons. The teacher should have a detailed plan for every
lesson, outlining her method of work, the leading questions for the
discussion, and the home assignments which she desires to make.</p>

<p>Foods that are in common use are suggested for the lessons
outlined. There will necessarily be exceptions to their use in
different localities. If any foods used in the homes are harmful
because of the manner in which they are prepared, the teacher
should do all in her power to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg047"
id="pg047">047</a></span>correct the situation, but she must, at
the same time, be careful not to be too radical. If the lessons
given are not followed by home practice, the time devoted to them
will be, to all intents and purposes, wasted. Simple meal service
should be introduced wherever it is possible, and as much
instruction on the furnishing and the care of the kitchen should be
included as time permits.</p>

<p>By the time the course is completed, the pupil should be able to
keep her kitchen in a sanitary condition and should have a
sufficient knowledge of food values and of the processes of cooking
to enable her to provide simple, wholesome meals for her
family.</p>

<p>For the teaching of food values, it will be helpful to secure
the set of sixteen food charts which may be obtained from the
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C., price one dollar.</p>

<p>It will be shown later how the school luncheon may be managed
with very little interference with the ordinary organization of the
school. Where definite instruction is given in Household Science, a
place must be provided for it on the school time-table, as is the
case with the other school subjects. In sewing and household
management lessons of forty minutes each are sufficient, and these
can be arranged for at the times found to be most convenient. If
each pupil keeps her sewing in a box or bag, it may often be used
as "busy work" when the pupil has finished her assigned work or
while she is waiting for the teacher, who may be engaged with
another class. Lessons in cookery should be, if possible, at least
one hour in length, and should be given at a time when this period
can be exceeded, if the character of the lesson renders it
desirable; for example, in those cases where the cooking <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg048" id="pg048">048</a></span>is not
completed at the expiration of the time assigned. For this reason
the last hour on Friday afternoon has proved a very suitable time.
In some schools the lesson is commenced at half-past three and runs
on until completed, and in this way only half an hour of the
regular school time is taken. The possibilities of a Saturday
morning cooking class should not be overlooked.</p>

COOKING</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Management of the kitchen stove. Cooking by
dry heat. Baked vegetable or fruit.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Foods.</i>&mdash;The body uses food to build and repair its
tissues, to provide heat and energy, and to regulate the body
processes. Foods differ from one another in their composition and
in their ability to assist the body in the performance of its
varied functions. These differences have led to the classification
of foods into five groups, which are spoken of as the five
food-stuffs or food principles.</p>

<p><i>Cooking.</i>&mdash;While some foods can be used as they occur
in nature, most of them are made more acceptable by the application
of heat. Heat softens the structure of vegetables and fruits, makes
tender the tissues of meat, prepares starch for digestion, develops
the flavour in many foods, and destroys the parasites and germs
that may be present. The five food-stuffs are differently affected
by heat&mdash;some require slow cooking, others require intense
heat. Hence, it is necessary to study cooking, in order that each
food may be properly prepared.</p>

<p><i>The stove.</i>&mdash;A knowledge of the construction of the
stove and the methods whereby heat is obtained is imperative if one
is to be a successful cook. For all stoves three things are
necessary&mdash;fuel, a supply of oxygen, and a certain degree of
heat, known as the kindling point, whereby the fire is started. The
supply of oxygen is regulated by dampers and checks so arranged as
to admit or cut off the draught of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg051" id=
"pg051">051</a></span>The creative dampers are doors or slides that
come below the fire box. When open, they admit the entrance of air,
increase the draught, and facilitate combustion.</p>

<p>The oven damper is a flat plate which closes the opening into
the chimney flue, to decrease the drawing of the draught. When the
oven damper is closed, the heat from the fire remains in the stove
and passes around the oven.</p>

<p>Checks are doors or slides higher than the fire-box, which, when
open, allow the cold air to pass over the fire, retarding
combustion.</p>

<p>A stove is also provided with means for disposing of the ashes,
soot, and the gases formed. All parts of the stove are so arranged
that they may be kept clean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">(See Twenty Lessons in the Care of the Home.
<a href="#pg007">Lesson I</a>)</div>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>There should be provided for this lesson (from the homes of the
pupils or the school garden), some fruit or vegetable in season
that can be cooked by dry heat. Each pupil may be able to bring an
apple or a potato. The teacher should be sure to have an oven that
can be well heated for baking and to have the fire well started
before the lesson begins, so that the oven will be ready for
use.</p>

<p>Lessons in geography and nature study should be correlated with
the cooking lesson, to give the pupils an opportunity to study the
source of foods and the reasons for cooking them.</p>

<p>One of the pupils should write the recipes on the black-board
before the lesson hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg052" id=
"pg052">052</a></span></p>
<h5>RECIPES</h5>

<div class="center2"><i>Baked Apples</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Wash the apples, core them, and cut through
the skin with a knife, so that the apple can expand in baking
without breaking the skin. Place the apples in a baking-dish and
fill each cavity with sugar. Cover the bottom of the dish with
water one quarter of an inch deep and bake until the apples are
soft (20 to 45 minutes), basting them every 10 minutes. Place them
in a serving dish and pour the juice over them. Serve hot or
cold.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Baked Potatoes</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Select smooth potatoes of medium size, scrub
carefully, and place in a baking-pan. Bake in a hot oven from 45
minutes to one hour. When soft, break the skin to let the steam
escape and serve at once.</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss very briefly the food that is to be cooked and the
method of cooking it. Have as many apples or potatoes baked as
there are members of the class or as the baking-dish will hold.</p>

<p>Assign tasks to special members of the class.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible put the vegetable or fruit in the oven to
bake.</p>

<p>While the baking is in process, take up a general discussion of
foods and cooking and a special discussion of the food which is
being used and the method of cooking that is being employed.</p>

<p>Give as thorough a lesson on the stove and combustion as time
permits. Examine the baked article and discuss the methods of
serving it, the time for serving, and so on.</p>

<p>Use the finished product for the school lunch or have it served
daintily in the class. Encourage the pupils to bring a dish to
school in order to take the results of their <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg053" id="pg053">053</a></span>work home for
the family meal, if a school lunch is not served or if they do not
need a lunch. Give careful directions for washing the dishes and
supervise the housework carefully. (See pages <a href=
"#pg052">52</a>, <a href="#pg053">53</a>, <i>Household
Management</i>.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;It may be necessary to go on with some other recitation
before the baking is completed, in which case one member of the
class should be appointed to watch the oven.</div>

<div class="center">Questions Used to Develop the Lesson</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="two">What food have we on hand for use to-day?</p>

<p class="two">Does this food need cooking? Why?</p>

<p class="two">How shall we prepare it for cooking?</p>

their work.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The recipes given in this Manual are prepared for normal
times; but in every case the Regulations of the Canada Food Board

<div class="center">LESSON II: PREPARING AND SERVING
VEGETABLES</div>

<p class="three"><i>Water and mineral matter in vegetables. How to
prepare and serve uncooked vegetables&mdash;lettuce, cress,
cabbage, etc. Cooking by moist heat. How to boil, season, and serve
beet tops, turnip tops, cabbage, sprouts, kale, spinach, mustard,
or other vegetable greens.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg054" id=
"pg054">054</a></span></p>
<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Water.</i>&mdash;All fluids and tissues of the body contain
large quantities of water, therefore water is regarded as one of
the most important food-stuffs required by the body. Practically
all foods contain some water. Fresh vegetables and fruits provide
the body with a high percentage of water.</p>

<p>Water is a valuable medium for cooking. As it heats, small
bubbles are formed, which continually increase in number and size,
but gradually disappear. Some time before the boiling-point is
reached, an occasional large bubble will rise to the surface and
disappear. The water has then reached the simmering-point,
185&deg;, a temperature frequently made use of in cooking. When
many bubbles form and break, causing a commotion on the surface of
the water, the boiling-point, 212&deg;, has been reached.</p>

<p><i>Mineral matter.</i>&mdash;Mineral matter is a second
food-stuff that is needed by the body, but the amount required is
very small. If a variety of food is used, there is generally
sufficient mineral matter in the diet. Fruits and vegetables,
especially fresh green vegetables, are comparatively rich in
mineral matter. Mineral matter builds up the bones and certain
tissues, such as the hair, teeth, and nails, and regulates the body
processes by keeping the blood and digestive fluids in proper
condition.</p>

<p><i>Green vegetables.</i>&mdash;Green vegetables hold an
important place in the diet, because they contain valuable mineral
matter. They also contain a high percentage of water and
considerable cellulose. With few exceptions they should be eaten
raw, because the mineral salts, being soluble, are lost in the
water in which they are cooked and because the cellulose serves its
purpose best in the crisp form. Cabbage is rendered much more
difficult of digestion by cooking. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg055" id="pg055">055</a></span>Spinach, beet tops, etc., are more
palatable when cooked. The delicately flavoured vegetables should
be boiled in a very small amount of water, so that they need not be
drained. Thus the mineral matter will be retained when the
vegetables are served.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>There should be provided for the lesson (from the homes of the
pupils or the school garden), some fresh vegetables in season; one
that can be cooked by boiling and one that can be served uncooked
with a simple dressing.</p>

<p>One of the pupils should write the recipes on the black-board
before the lesson hour.</p>


<h5>RECIPES</h5>

<div class="center2"><i>Preparation of Fresh <a href="#GV">Green

<div class="blockquot">Mix the dry ingredients, add the egg

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap"><a name="GV" id="GV">[A] Note</a></span>.&mdash;It may be well to omit from this lesson the uncooked
vegetable that is served in the form of a salad and to give it at
some other time. It is not well to attempt to teach more than the
pupils can master thoroughly.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg056" id=
"pg056">056</a></span><i>Recipe for Boiling and Seasoning Fresh
Green Vegetables</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Wash the vegetables carefully and put them
on to cook in boiling water. Delicately flavoured vegetables
(spinach, celery, fresh peas, etc.) will require but little water,
and that should be allowed to boil away at the last. If spinach is
stirred constantly, no water need be added. Starchy vegetables
should be completely covered with water, and strongly flavoured
vegetables (as turnips, onions, cabbage, and cauliflower) should be
cooked in water at simmering temperature.<br />
<br />
After the vegetables have cooked for a few minutes, salt should be
added, one teaspoonful to each quart of water. Cook the vegetable
until it can be easily pierced with a fork. Let the water boil away
at the last. If it is necessary to drain, do so as soon as the
vegetable is tender. Season with salt, pepper, and butter (&frac14;
teaspoon salt, &#8539; teaspoon pepper, and &frac12; tablespoon
butter to each cup of vegetable).</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The water in which the vegetables are cooked should be
saved for soups and sauces, as it contains most of the valuable
mineral matter.</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss the heating of water and apply the facts to cooking.
Have the pupils observe and describe the heating of water.</p>

<p>If a new tin sauce-pan or other bright tin vessel is at hand in
which to heat the water, the changes which take place as the
temperature increases will be more readily apparent, and the pupils
will enjoy watching the process.</p>

<p>Discuss why one vegetable is to be cooked and another served
uncooked.</p>

<p>Emphasize the cleaning of the vegetable, its structure,
composition, and the effect of the boiling water upon it.</p>

<p>After the vegetable has been put on to cook, discuss the method
of seasoning or dressing the vegetable which is to be served
uncooked, and have it prepared attractively to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg057" id="pg057">057</a></span>serve on the
plates. Especial emphasis should be placed on the use and
importance of fresh, green vegetables.</p>

<p>Continue the discussion of vegetables, letting the members of
the class suggest others that may be prepared as salads or cooked
in the manner being illustrated, and write the list on the
black-board for the pupils to copy in their note-books.</p>

<p>When the cooked vegetable is tender, have it drained, seasoned,
and served, and serve the uncooked vegetable at the same time.</p>

<p>When ready for serving, let the pupils arrange their plates and
forks carefully, then let them all sit down except the two who pass
the vegetables. Be sure that they eat carefully and daintily.</p>

<p>Emphasize the careful washing of the dishes, etc., as on the
previous day.</p>

DIET</div>

<p class="three"><i>Potatoes as a source of carbohydrates. The
choice, cost, care, composition, food value, and cooking of
potatoes, baked squash, steamed squash.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Carbohydrates.</i>&mdash;A third class of food-stuffs
required by the body is known as the carbohydrates, or sugars and
starches. This class of foods is used as fuel, for the production
of heat and energy in the body. Excess of carbohydrates may be
stored in the body as fatty tissue.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Potatoes are a cheap source of
carbohydrates. They are also valuable for their mineral matter and
for the large quantity of water which they contain. Three fourths
of the potato is water. The framework of the potato is cellulose,
which is an indigestible carbohydrate material. Potatoes have only
a small amount of cellulose, however, and they are comparatively
easy of digestion. When dry and mealy, they are most digestible.
When used for a meal, potatoes should be supplemented by some
muscle-building food, such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, or
meat.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>At some previous period the teacher should have discussed with
the pupils the use of potatoes and learned from them the different
ways in which they cook them in their homes. She should determine
upon some recipes for the lesson that will increase the variety of
ways in which potatoes may be served and that will improve the
methods used in the homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg059" id=

two potatoes for the lesson. The best methods of cooking and the
means of securing variety should be emphasized.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON IV: FRUITS AND VEGETABLES</div>

<p class="three"><i>Food value and use of fruits. Reasons and rules
for canning. How to can and use such vegetables as beets, beans,
tomatoes, and carrots, and such fruits as figs, grapes, apples, and
peaches. The drying of fruits and vegetables.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Fruits impart palatability and flavour to other foods and
exercise a favourable influence upon the digestive <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg061" id="pg061">061</a></span>organs, though
their food value is low. They contain a high percentage of water
and only a small percentage of nutrients. Most fruits are eaten raw
and are exceedingly valuable to the body because of the fresh acids
they contain. Cooking softens the cellulose of the fruit and,
therefore, renders some fruits more easy of digestion. The cooking
of fruit is of value chiefly for the purpose of preservation.</p>

<p><i>The drying of fruits.</i>&mdash;Fruits are dried so that they
may be preserved for use. Bacteria and moulds, which cause the
decay of fruits, need moisture for development and growth. If the
moisture is evaporated, the fruits will keep almost indefinitely.
Fruits and vegetables can be easily and inexpensively dried. When
dried fruits are to be used for the table, they must be washed
thoroughly and soaked for several hours, or overnight, in water, so
as to restore to them as much water as possible. They should be
cooked, until soft, in the same water in which they are soaked.</p>

<p><i>Canning and preserving.</i>&mdash;Other methods of
preservation are desirable, in order that vegetables and fruits be
made of value for a longer period of time than through their
ripening season. Canning is one of the methods most commonly
employed in the home, being both easy and satisfactory. Fruit which
is to be canned is first sterilized by boiling or steaming, in
order to destroy all germs and spores. This can be adequately
accomplished by boiling for twenty minutes, but a shorter time is
sometimes sufficient. In order to ensure complete success, all
germs must also be destroyed on the cans and on everything which
comes in contact with the food. This will be effected by boiling or
steaming for twenty minutes. The jars, covers, dipper, and funnel
should all be placed <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg062" id=
"pg062">062</a></span>in cold water, heated until the water comes
to the boiling-point, boiled five minutes, and left in the water
until just before sealing. As for the rubbers, it will be
sufficient to dip them into the boiling water. After the fruit has
been put into the can, it must be sealed so that it is perfectly
air-tight. In order to do this, it is necessary to have good
covers, with new, pliable rubbers, and to see to it that they fit
tightly.</p>

<p>When the jar is to be filled, it should be placed on a board or
wooden table, or on a cloth wrung out of hot water, and should be
filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>Sugar is not essential to sterilization and is used only to
improve the flavour. Both fruits and vegetables can be canned
without sugar. However, fruits canned with a large amount of sugar
do not spoil readily, for germs develop slowly in a thick
syrup.</p>

<p><i>Methods of canning.</i>&mdash;The simplest method of canning
is the "Open-kettle Method" employed for small, watery fruits, such
as berries, grapes, tomatoes, etc. The fruit is boiled in an open
kettle (which permits of the evaporation of some of the water in
the fruit) and transferred at once to a sterilized jar, which is
immediately sealed.</p>

<p>Another and safer method, which secures more complete
sterilization without serious change of flavour in the fruit, is
that known as the "Cold-pack Method". After being transferred to
the cans, the vegetable or fruit is subjected to an additional
period of heating of considerable length, or to three periods of
briefer length on three successive days. If the three periods of
sterilization are used, the process is known as the "Intermittent
Method".</p>

<p>The Single Process Method is described in the recipe for canned
beets. The Intermittent Process proves more satisfactory for canned
beans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg063" id=
"pg063">063</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should ascertain what fruits and vegetables are most
abundant and select for canning those that the class can
provide.</p>

<p>Each pupil should be asked to bring some vegetable or fruit,
some granulated sugar, and a jar in which to can her fruit. If the
school does not possess enough kettles or sauce-pans in which to do
the cooking, they may be borrowed from the homes.</p>

<p>Only one fruit or one vegetable should be taken up at a time,
for the preparation necessarily varies slightly, and the different
methods will prove confusing. It is not necessary to confine the
choice of fruits and vegetables to those mentioned in the recipes
included here. The teacher will find it better to base her
instruction on the products of the particular time and place. The
principles of canning should be taken up at some other period, if
possible, in order that the cooking lesson may be devoted entirely
to the practical work.</p>


<h5>RECIPES</h5>

<div class="center2"><i>Canned Tomatoes</i></div>

<div class="center2">(Open-kettle Method)</div>

<div class="blockquot">Scald and peel the tomatoes. Boil gently for
20 minutes. Sterilize the jars, covers, and rubbers. Stand the jars
on a cloth in a pan of hot water or on a board or wooden table.
Fill the jars with hot tomatoes, being careful to fill to
overflowing and to expel all air bubbles from the jar. Adjust the
rubbers and covers. Seal and allow to cool. Test, label, and set
away in a cool, dry, dark place.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg064" id=
"pg064">064</a></span>(Cold-pack Method)</div>

<div class="blockquot">Scald in water hot enough to loosen the
skins. Plunge quickly in cold water and remove the skins. Pack
whole or in pieces in the jars. Fill the jars with tomatoes only.
Add 1 level teaspoonful of salt to each quart. Place the rubber and
cover in position. Partially seal, but not tightly. Place the jars
on a rack in a boiler. Pour sufficient warm water into the boiler
to come half-way up the jars. Place the filled jars on the rack so
as not to touch one another, and pack the spaces between them with
cotton, to prevent the jars striking when the water boils.
Sterilize for 22 minutes after the water begins to boil. Remove the
jars from the boiler. Tighten the covers. Invert to cool, and test
the joints. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching and store
in a cool, dry, dark place. This method of cooking is also called
"The Hot Water Bath".</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Canned Grapes</i></div>

<div class="center2">(Open-kettle Method)</div>

<table width="70%" summary="Canned Grapes-Open kettle" border="0">
<tr>
<td class="cell_list7">6 qt. grapes</td>
<td class="cell_list7">1 qt. sugar</td>
<td class="cell_list7">&frac12; c. water</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="blockquot">Pick over, wash, drain, and remove the stems
from the grapes. Separate the pulp from the skins. Cook the pulp 5
minutes and then rub through a sieve that is fine enough to hold
back the seeds. Put the water, skins, and pulp into the preserving
kettle and heat slowly to the boiling-point. Skim the fruit and
then add the sugar. Boil 15 minutes. Put into jars as
directed.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Sweet grapes may be canned with less sugar;
very sour grapes will require more sugar.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Canned Peaches</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Choose firm, solid fruit. Scald long enough
to loosen the skins. Peel and cut in halves. If clingstone peaches
are used, they may be canned whole. Pack the fruit into sterilized
jars, fill with boiling syrup (1 c. sugar to 1&frac12; c. water).
Then put on the covers loosely and place on wooden racks in the
boiler. Sterilize in hot water bath for 20 minutes. Remove the jars
and tighten the covers. Invert to cool, and test the joints. Wrap
the jars in paper to prevent bleaching; then store.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg065" id=
"pg065">065</a></span><i>Canned Beets</i></div>

<div class="center2">(Single Process)</div>

<div class="blockquot">Wash the beets and boil them until they are
nearly tender and the skins come off easily. Remove the skins and
carefully pack the beets in a jar. Cover with boiling water, to
which one tablespoonful of salt is added for each quart, and put
the cover on the jar, but do not fasten it down. Place the jar on a
rack or a folded cloth in a large kettle that can be closely
covered. Pour enough water into the kettle to reach within two
inches of the top of the jar, cover the kettle, bring the water to
the boiling-point, and boil from one and one-half to two hours. As
the water around the jar boils down, replenish with boiling water,
never with cold. Remove the jars and tighten the covers. Invert to
cool, and test the joints. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent
bleaching; then store.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In canning beets, if vinegar is added to the water in the
proportion of one part vinegar to four parts water, the natural
bright colour will be retained.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Canned String Beans and Peas</i></div>

<div class="center2">(Intermittent Method)</div>

<div class="blockquot">Can on the same day that the vegetables are
picked. Blanch in boiling water from 2 to 5 minutes. Remove, and
plunge into cold water. Pack in sterilized jars. Add boiling water
to fill the crevices. Add 1 level teaspoonful of salt to each
quart. Place rubbers and covers in position.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Set the jars on the rack in the boiler and
bring gradually to boiling heat. At the end of an hour's boiling,
remove the jars from the boiler. Tighten the clamps or rims and set
the jars aside to cool until the following day. Do not let the
vegetables cool off in the boiler, as this results in over-cooking.
On the second day, loosen the clamps or unscrew the rims, place the
jars in warm water, heat again to boiling temperature, and boil for
an hour; then remove them again. On the third day, repeat the
hour's boiling, as on the preceding day.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Corn may be canned successfully in the same
way.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg066" id=
"pg066">066</a></span><i>Dried Corn</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Pick the corn early in the morning.
Immediately husk, silk, and cut the corn from the cob. Spread in a
very thin layer on a board, cover with mosquito netting which is
kept sufficiently elevated so that it will not come in contact with
the corn, place in the hot sun, and leave all day. Before the dew
begins to fall, take it into the house and place in an oven that is
slightly warm. Leave in the oven overnight and place out in the sun
again the next day. Repeat this process until absolutely dry.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>String Beans</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">String beans are hung up to dry and kept for
winter use.</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>If possible, let each pupil can a jar of vegetables or fruit for
her own home. If the class is large, let the pupils work in groups
of two or three.</p>

<p>Begin the lesson with a very brief discussion of how to prepare
fruit for canning.</p>

<p>Let the pupils proceed with the practical work as quickly as
possible. Demonstrate the method of filling and sealing the
jars.</p>

<p>Assign the care of the jars and the intermittent canning on
succeeding days to members of the class, and hold them responsible
for the completion of the work.</p>

<p>The drying of some vegetables can be undertaken at school, and
carefully followed from day to day. It will furnish the pupils with
an interesting problem.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON V:
FATS&mdash;VEGETABLES&mdash;Continued</div>

<p class="three"><i>Preparation of white sauce to serve with
vegetables. How to boil, season, and serve such vegetables as lima
or butter beans, string beans, onions, cabbage, corn, beets,
turnips, or carrots.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg067" id=
"pg067">067</a></span></p>
<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>

<p><i>Fats.</i>&mdash;Butter belongs to the class of food-stuffs
known as fats. It increases the fuel value of those dishes to which
it is added.</p>

<p>Fats supply heat and energy to the body in a concentrated form.
For this reason they should be used in a limited quantity. Fats
undergo several changes during the process of digestion, and the
excessive use of them interferes with the digestion of other foods
and throws a large amount of work upon the digestive organs. Cooked
fats are more difficult of digestion than uncooked fats, and other
foods cooked with hot fat are rendered more difficult to
digest.</p>

<p><i>Vegetables.</i>&mdash;Vegetables should be used when in
season, as they are always best and cheapest then. They are better
kept in a cold, dry, and dark place.</p>

<p>If the vegetables contain starch or tough cellulose, they will
require cooking; as raw starch is indigestible, and the harsh
cellulose may be too irritating to the digestive tract.</p>

<p>In old or exceedingly large vegetables the cellulose may be very
tough; hence a long period of cooking is necessary. They should be
cooked only until they are tender. Longer cooking may destroy the
flavour, render the vegetables difficult of digestion, and cause
the colour to change. In very young vegetables the cellulose is
delicate and, if young vegetables do not contain much starch, they
may be eaten raw.</p>

<p>When cooked vegetables are served, they are usually seasoned and
dressed with butter (for one cup of vegetables use &frac12;
teaspoonful of salt, &#8539; teaspoonful of pepper, and &frac12;
tablespoonful of fat), or a sauce is prepared to serve with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg068" id=
"pg068">068</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It may be well to have a preliminary lesson devoted to simple
experiments with flour, liquid, and fat, in order to determine the
best method of combining the ingredients in the white sauce.
However, if the lesson period is of sufficient length, a few of
these experiments may be performed in connection with it.</p>

<p>There should be provided for the lesson some vegetable that is
improved by serving with white sauce, and sufficient milk, butter
or other fat, flour, and salt for the sauce and the experiments.
Discuss with the pupils the fat that is used in their homes, in
order to know what is available.</p>

<p>The recipes should be written on the black-board before the
lesson hour.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON VI: CEREALS</div>

<p class="three"><i>Kinds, composition, care, and general rules for
cooking cereals. Oatmeal, cracked wheat, corn-meal porridge, rice.
Fruits to serve with cereals&mdash;stewed prunes, stewed apples, or
apple sauce.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>The term "cereals" is applied to the cultivated
grasses&mdash;rice, wheat, corn, rye, oats, and buckwheat. They are
widely grown throughout the temperate zone and are prepared in
various forms for use as food. Cereals contain a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg071" id="pg071">071</a></span>high percentage
of starch and a low percentage of water, with varying proportions
of mineral matter and fat. In addition to the four food-stuffs
already studied, cereals contain a small amount of another
food-stuff known as protein&mdash;a muscle-building material. For
the most part, the cereals contain a large amount of cellulose,
which is broken up during the process of preparation for market and
requires long cooking before being ready for use by the body. The
digestibility of the cereals depends upon the amount of cellulose
which they contain and the thoroughness of the cooking. Cereals are
palatable, and they are valuable, because in cooking they can be
blended in various ways with other substances. They are beneficial
also to the body, because their cellulose acts mechanically on the
digestive organs by stimulating them to action. Cereals are made
more attractive by serving with fresh or cooked fruit.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The cereals should be discussed in a nature study or geography
lesson, and two or three kinds that are in common use should be
brought from home by the pupils. If cereals are not generally used
as breakfast foods, the lesson may be a means of introducing them.
Some pupils should bring a little milk and sugar, to serve with the
cooked cereal. Apples or prunes should be brought, to cook and
serve with the cereal.</p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>As soon as the class meets, discuss the recipes briefly and put
the cereals on to cook at once. Prepare the fruit. While the long
cooking of the cereal is in progress, discuss the composition, food
value, and methods of using cereals. Then go on with another lesson
and call the class together, for serving, later in the day. Serve
the fruit and the cereals together.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON VII: CLASSIFICATION OF
FOODS&mdash;Reviewed</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Those foods which build up and repair the muscular tissues of
the body are called protein foods, muscle builders, or flesh
formers. Meat, fish, eggs, cheese, milk, cereals, legumes, and nuts
are classed as protein foods.</p>

<p>Those foods which serve solely as fuel for the
body&mdash;providing heat and energy&mdash;are classed under two
groups: the carbohydrates (sugar and starches), which the body is
able to use in relatively large quantities; and the fats, which the
body cannot use in such large quantities, but which yield a large
amount of heat and energy. Protein also serves as fuel, though
tissue building is regarded as its special function. Sugars and
starches are abundant in fruits and vegetables. Fats are found in
meats, fish, milk, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg074" id=
"pg074">074</a></span>and in some vegetable foods. Heat-giving food
may be stored in the body as fatty tissue.</p>

<p>Mineral compounds must be present in our food, to help in the
regulation of the body processes and to enter into the composition
of the structure and the fluids of the body. Mineral compounds are
best supplied by fresh green vegetables, fruits, and milk.</p>

<p>Water is absolutely essential to the body, is present in large
quantities in many foods, and is combined with many other foods
during the processes of cooking.</p>

<p>One or more of the food-stuffs sometimes predominate in a single
food. For example, rice is almost entirely carbohydrate, and butter
is almost pure fat. Occasionally, we find a food that contains all
the five groups of food principles. Milk is an example of such a
food, containing all five food principles in such proportions as to
supply all the nourishment which a baby needs during the early
months of its life. As the child grows older, foods rich in both
carbohydrates must be added to the diet. Wheat contains all that
the body needs for nourishment except water, which is easily added
in cooking.</p>

<p><i>Choice of food.</i>&mdash;The diet must be carefully chosen,
to give a needed variety and to combine the foods properly so that
one may have a right proportion of all the food-stuffs. Each meal
should contain some protein food, some fats or carbohydrates, some
mineral matter, and water. All five forms of food-stuffs should
have a place in the day's diet. The greater part of the water which
the body needs should be taken between meals.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Review the foods discussed in the previous lessons and sum up
the classification of foods, being sure that the <span class=

common examples of each. Discuss simple combinations for the
different meals, using dishes already prepared in the course and

<div class="center">LESSON VIII: THE PLANNING AND SERVING OF
MEALS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Experience has shown that some foods are more acceptable at one
time of day than other foods, and that certain combinations are
more pleasing than others. The choice of foods will also depend
upon the season of the year. For example, breakfast is, as a rule,
made up of simple foods that are not highly seasoned nor subjected
to elaborate methods of cooking. A fruit, a cereal, and bread,
with, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg077" id=
"pg077">077</a></span>possibly, eggs or meat, are served at
breakfast. A hot beverage is added by most people to this meal.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, dinner consists of a hot meat or other protein
dish, with one or two vegetables. Soup, salad, and a sweet dessert
are often served. The soup is served before the meat course, and
the salad and dessert follow it. The dessert may be a fruit, a
cookie or other pastry, a pudding, or a frozen dish.</p>

<p>Lunch or supper may be a very simple meal, consisting of a soup
with crackers, one protein dish (eggs, milk, or meat) with bread
and stewed fruit, or a salad, with a simple dessert.</p>

<p>The table should always be neatly set, with individual places
arranged for each one who is to partake of the meal. Each place
should be wide enough for a plate, with a knife and spoon at the
right and a fork at the left side. A tumbler should be placed at
the point of the knife and a napkin at the left of the fork.
Everything on the table should be perfectly clean, the napkin
should be neatly folded, and all the articles should be uniformly
arranged, in order to give a neat appearance to the table. A flower
or plant in the centre will add to its attractiveness. Salt,
pepper, sugar, vinegar, and anything of the kind that may be needed
with the meal should be arranged where it can be easily reached.
Fresh water should be poured into the tumblers just before the meal
is served. The bread, butter, and so on, may be put on the table
several minutes before the meal is announced, but the hot dishes
should be placed immediately before the family is seated.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>If Lesson VI, entitled "Setting and Clearing the Table" as
outlined in the course on the Care of the Home has been given, this
lesson may be devoted to what to serve and how to serve it, or it
may precede the lesson on "Waiting on Table". The manner of serving
may be demonstrated in the next lesson, in connection with the
course on the Care of the Home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg079" id=
"pg079">079</a></span>Simple equipment for family service will be
required, if the form of serving is to be taken up. For class
practice, a table for four may be arranged. This will necessitate a
table-cover, four dinner plates, four bread-and-butter plates, four
tumblers, four cups and saucers, four knives, four forks, four
teaspoons, four napkins, a platter, one serving spoon, and one
serving fork.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Discuss meal service from the standpoint both of choice and
combination of foods and of the method of service. Let the class
plan a meal, then go through the form of serving that meal at
table. In the absence of a table, the top of a desk may be used.
Later in the course, the teacher should plan to combine this lesson
with one on cooking and have the food served. In each cooking
lesson, suggestions for serving the food should be made, and each
dish cooked should be carefully served. Interest in this lesson may
be increased by allowing the pupils to make original menus, and, if
they are having some lessons in drawing, simple menu cards may be
planned and executed.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON IX: MILK</div>

<p class="three"><i>Care, cost, and food value of milk. Value and
use of sour milk&mdash;cottage cheese, curdled milk. Rice or
cornstarch pudding (plain, caramel, or chocolate).</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Milk contains all the food-stuffs which the body requires,
except starch, and, therefore, is capable of sustaining life for
comparatively long periods. It is one of the most important protein
foods; but it contains so small a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg080" id="pg080">080</a></span>percentage of carbohydrate (milk
sugar) that for the adult it must be supplemented with carbohydrate
foods. For the baby, milk is a perfect food, and it is a valuable
adjunct to the diet of all children. One quart of milk should be
allowed for the diet of each child daily, after the twelfth month;
and the diet of the adult should be supplemented by the use of
milk. The greatest care should be exercised in protecting milk from
dust and dirt, for it is easily contaminated and may be the means
of carrying disease germs to the body. The changes which milk
undergoes when souring do not render it harmful. For many people
buttermilk is more easy of digestion than sweet milk, because of
the changes produced by souring, as well as the absence of fat.
Sour milk is of value in cooking, producing a tender bread which
can readily be made light by the addition of soda&mdash;one
teaspoonful of soda to one pint of sour milk that has curdled.</p>

<p>In the preparation of cheese, the whey is separated from the
curds, thus extracting most of the water, sugar, and mineral
matter, and leaving a substance rich in protein and fat. Cheese is
of value in cooking, for it increases the food value of those foods
to which it is added.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should make inquiries a few days in advance, to be
sure that one quart of sour milk can be secured, and, when it is
brought, she should examine it to see that it is in proper
condition to make cottage cheese. She should arrange to have about
one quart of sweet milk and such other supplies as are necessary
for the pudding, brought by the pupils.</p>

<p>An opportunity may be afforded to discuss the use of left-over
cereal by the preparation of a rice pudding, if <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg081" id="pg081">081</a></span>the teacher
provides some cold cooked rice for the lesson. In the absence of
cold rice, the cornstarch pudding may be prepared.</p>


<h5>RECIPES</h5>

<div class="center2"><i>Cottage Cheese</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Heat sour milk slowly until the whey rises
to the top, pour the whey off, put the curd in a bag, and let it
drip for six hours without squeezing. Put the curd into a bowl and
break into fine pieces with a wooden spoon; season with salt and
mix into a paste with a little cream or butter. Mould into balls,
if desired, and keep in a cold place. (It is best when
fresh.)</div>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>

cottage cheese. Show the separation of curd and whey, by adding
vinegar or lemon juice to sweet milk. While the cheese is draining,
make assignments of work and have the rice or cornstarch pudding
made.</p>

<p>In this lesson and in those following emphasize the use of
protein foods.</p>

<p>Discuss also the food value of skimmed milk and sour milk and
the purposes for which these may be used in cooking.</p>

<p>Use the cottage cheese and the pudding for the school lunch.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON X: SOUPS</div>

<p class="three"><i>Cream soups. Cream of carrot, potato, or onion
soup, green pea soup. Toast, croutons, or crisp crackers to serve
with soup.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Cream soups.</i>&mdash;The strained pulp of cooked vegetables
or legumes, with an equal portion of thin white sauce, is the basis
for cream soups. The liquid for the soup may be all milk, part
vegetable water and part milk, or all vegetable water.</p>

<p>A binding of flour is used to prevent a separation of the
thicker and the thinner parts of the soup. This is combined as for
white sauce and is stirred into the hot liquid just before the soup
is to be served. The soup should be made in a double boiler and
kept in this utensil until it is served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg083" id="pg083">083</a></span>
Four tablespoons of flour to each quart of soup is a good
proportion to use for thickening all vegetable soups that are not
of a starchy nature; half that amount will be sufficient for soup
prepared from a very starchy vegetable.</p>

<p>The value of the vegetable water should be impressed upon the
pupils, and it should be pointed out that these soups are an
excellent way of using the cooking water and any left-over
vegetables. From these, attractive cream soups may be prepared, and
a combination of flavours often gives good results.</p>

<p><i>Accompaniments.</i>&mdash;Crisp crackers, croutons, soup
sticks, or bread sticks are served with cream soups, and are
valuable because they necessitate thorough mastication, thus
inducing the flow of saliva and aiding in the digestion of the
starchy ingredients of the soups.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>As a basis for the soup, the teacher should secure a vegetable
that the pupils use in their own homes, and crackers or bread to

<p>If dried peas are used, they should be allowed to soak overnight
and be put on to cook early in the morning.</p>

<p>It will be well to have the cooking of the carrots begun before
the lesson period. If the carrots are cut up in small pieces, they
will cook more quickly.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XI: EGGS</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Food value and general rules for cooking
eggs. Cooked in shell, poached, scrambled, and omelet.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Eggs are a very valuable food, because of the large amount of
protein and fat they contain. Though lacking in carbohydrates, they
furnish material for building up the muscles and provide heat and
energy to the body. If cooked at a low temperature, eggs are very
easily and very completely digested. Combined with other foods,
they serve as a thickening agent (for sauces and soups) and as a
means of making batters light (popovers and sponge cake). They add
flavour and colour and increase the nutritive value of other
foods.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The lesson on eggs furnishes one of the best opportunities to
teach the muscle-building foods. If eggs are scarce, it may be well
to give this lesson at some other time. Each pupil should be asked
to bring an egg; one or two should bring a little milk; and
sufficient bread should be provided to toast for the poached eggs.
The teacher should not undertake to give too many recipes in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg086" id="pg086">086</a></span>this
lesson, but should try to make the pupils familiar with a
sufficient variety of ways of using eggs to make egg cookery
interesting. The necessity of having a moderate temperature for the
cooking of eggs should be emphasized.</p>


<h5>RECIPES</h5>

<div class="center2"><i>Soft-cooked Eggs</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Put the eggs in boiling water sufficient to
cover them, remove from the fire, cover, and allow them to stand
from 5 to 8 minutes.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Hard-cooked Eggs</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Put the eggs in cold water, heat, and, when
the water boils, reduce the heat, and let them stand for 20 minutes
with water just below the boiling-point, then put them into cold
water.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Poached Eggs</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Break each egg into a saucer carefully, slip
the egg into boiling water, decrease the heat, and cook for 5
minutes, or until the white is firm and a film has formed over the
yolk. Take up with a skimmer, drain, trim off the rough edges, and
serve on slices of toast. Season.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Poached eggs are attractive when covered
with white sauce to which chopped parsley has been added.</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Baked Eggs</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">Line a buttered baking-dish with buttered
bread crumbs or with cold mashed potatoes. Break the eggs in the
dish without separating and add one tablespoon of milk or cream for
each egg. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with grated
cheese, if desired. Bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are
set.</div>

set and evenly browned underneath. Put it into a hot oven for a few
minutes, to dry slightly on top, fold, and serve immediately.
Serves one.</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg088" id=
"pg088">088</a></span></p>
<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Devote one half of the class period to a discussion of the
structure of the egg and the effect of heat upon it. Use simple
experiments or watch the poached egg, to make a study of the
changes produced in the egg by the application of heat. If the
pupils are sufficiently experienced, let them work together in
small groups, first scrambling an egg, then making an omelet.
Demonstrate the cooking of the omelet before the entire class.
Serve the egg dishes carefully while hot.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>The omelet recipes
given are for individual portions. To make a large omelet, multiply
the quantity of each ingredient by the number of eggs used. The
best results will be obtained by making an omelet of not more than
four eggs, as larger omelets are difficult to cook thoroughly and
to handle well. A two-egg omelet will serve three people. A
four-egg omelet will serve six people.</p>
</div>

<div class="center">LESSON XII: SIMPLE
DESSERTS&mdash;CUSTARDS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>A custard is a combination of eggs and milk, usually sweetened
and flavoured, and either steamed, or baked as cup custard, or
cooked in a double boiler as soft custard. The whole egg may be
used or the yolks alone. The yolks make a smoother, richer
custard.</p>

<p>The eggs must be thoroughly mixed, but not beaten light, the
sugar and salt added, and the milk scalded and stirred in slowly.
The custard must be strained through a fine sieve and cooked at a
moderate temperature. It is desirable to strain a custard, in order
to remove the cords and pieces of the membrane which inclosed the
yolk. The cup custard should be strained before cooking, the soft
custard may be strained afterwards.</p>

<p>A soft custard is cooked over water and is stirred constantly
until done. When done, the froth disappears from the surface, the
custard is thickened and coats the spoon and sides of the pan, and
there is no sign of curdling. If the custard is cooked too long, it
becomes curdled. If <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg089" id=
"pg089">089</a></span>it becomes curdled, put it into a pan of cold
water and beat until smooth.</p>

<p>A steamed or baked custard is done when it becomes set and when
a silver knife will come out clean after cutting it.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>This lesson will furnish an opportunity for a review of milk and
eggs. The pupils should arrange to bring the necessary materials

<div class="center">LESSON XIII: BATTERS AND DOUGHS</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Griddle Cakes</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Batters.</i>&mdash;Batters are mixtures of flour or meal and
a liquid, with salt or sugar to give flavour, butter to make
tender, and steam, air, or gas to make light.</p>

<p>One scant measure of liquid is used with one measure <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg091" id="pg091">091</a></span>of flour
for thin, or pour, batter. One measure of liquid is used with two
measures of flour for a thick, or drop, batter. One measure of
liquid is used with three measures of flour for a soft, or bread,
dough. One measure of liquid is used with four measures of flour
for a stiff, or pastry, dough.</p>

<p>Before mixing a batter, the oven or griddle should be at the
proper temperature, with the fire well regulated and in good
condition. The oven should be tested by putting in a piece of white
paper or two tablespoonfuls of flour, which should brown in three
minutes. The pans should be prepared by greasing with lard, salt
pork, or beef dripping. All the materials should be measured and
ready before beginning to combine the ingredients. When the batter
has been mixed and beaten until smooth, it should be baked at
once.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher will be better prepared to give the lesson on
batters if she first makes herself familiar with the kinds of
breads that are used in the homes of the pupils and the methods
followed in their preparation. The simple, general methods of
preparing batters should be taught. The teacher should not attempt
the preparation of more than one or two batters in this lesson.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XIV: BATTERS AND
DOUGHS&mdash;Continued</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Muffins&mdash;Baking-powder
Biscuits</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Methods of making batters light.</i>&mdash;Batters are made
light by beating air into them, by adding eggs into which air has
been beaten, or by entangling gas in the batter. Gas is secured by
using soda and sour milk in a batter (one teaspoon of soda to one
pint of sour milk), or soda with molasses (one teaspoon of soda to
one cup of molasses), or soda with cream of tartar (one teaspoon of
soda with two slightly rounding teaspoons of cream of tartar). The
soda should be mixed well with the other dry ingredients, then the
sour milk or molasses added, the whole beaten up quickly, and baked
at once.</p>

<p>Baking-powder is a preparation containing soda and cream of
tartar, and may be used in place of soda if sweet milk is used. Two
level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder should be used with one cup of
flour.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XV: MEATS</div>

<p class="three"><i>Composition and food value. How to make tough
cuts of meat palatable. Pork chops with fried apples. Beef or
mutton stew with vegetables and dumplings. Rabbit stew.
Bacon.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Meats are rich in protein and usually in fats, but are lacking
in the carbohydrates. They build up the muscular tissue, furnish
heat and energy, are more stimulating and strengthening than any
other food, and satisfy hunger for a greater length of time. For
the most part, meats are a very expensive food. One cannot perform
more labour by the use of a meat diet than on a diet of vegetable
foods. Those who use large quantities of meat suffer from many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pg095" id=
"pg095">095</a></span>disturbances of the system. Hence it should
form a very small part of the diet. The cuts of meat that come from
those portions of the animal's body that are much exercised are
tough, owing to the development of the connective tissues, but they
contain a high percentage of nutrition. For the same reason, the
meat from older animals is apt to be tough. The flesh of chickens,
turkeys, and other fowls is very nutritious and is easily digested
if not too fat.</p>

<p>The flavour of meats is developed by cooking. Dry heat develops
the best flavour, hence the tender cuts are cooked by the processes
known as broiling and roasting. Tough cuts of meat require long,
slow cooking in moist heat, hence they are prepared in the form of
stews and pot roasts or are used in meat soups.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>After the teacher has found out what meats are used in the homes
or what the school can afford to use, she should determine upon a
method of cooking that will make the meat palatable, digestible,
and attractive. If it can be prepared as a stew, she should use a
recipe in which vegetables are also used and, if possible, have
dumplings prepared to serve with the meat, as a review of the
lesson on batters.</p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>If the meat is to require two or three hours' cooking, arrange
to have the lesson divided and given at two periods through the
day. Half an hour before opening the morning session or a portion
of the morning or noon recess may be sufficient time to put the
meat on to cook and to prepare the vegetables. When the second
class period is called, the vegetables should be added to the
partially cooked meat and the dumplings should be made. It would be
well to serve the completed dish at the lunch period. There should
be as much discussion regarding the kinds of meat, their food
value, and the methods of cooking as time permits; but it may be
necessary to complete this discussion at some other class
period.</p>

<p>Should it be possible for the teacher to give additional lessons
on meat, it might be well to devote one lesson to the preparation
and cooking of poultry, directions for which may be secured from
any reliable cook-book.</p>

BEANS&mdash;BAKING-POWDER BISCUITS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Peas, beans, and lentils which are dried for market contain a
high percentage of protein, carbohydrate, and mineral matter. They
form an excellent substitute for meat and are much cheaper in
price. The digestion of leguminous foods proceeds slowly, involving
a large amount of work: on this account they are not desirable for
invalids, but they are satisfactory for those who are well and
active. The dried legumes must be soaked overnight in water and
then cooked for a long time, in order to soften the cellulose and
develop the flavour.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It will be necessary to plan this lesson several days in
advance, if the beans are to be baked. As they will be prepared and
put on to bake before the lesson period, the Baking-powder Biscuits
may be made during the lesson, to serve with them.</p>

<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>Have the beans washed and put to soak the night before the
lesson is to be given. Assign to one of the pupils the task of
putting them on to simmer early the next morning. Call the class
together for a few moments when the beans are ready to bake. Assign
one of the pupils to attend to the fire and the oven. Let the beans
bake all day. If the lesson is to be given late in the afternoon,
the beans may be ready to serve, or the cooking may be continued on
the second day and the lesson completed then. It would be well to
serve the dish at the lunch period. Have the biscuits prepared to
serve with the baked beans.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XVII: BUTTER CAKES&mdash;PLAIN YELLOW
CAKE&mdash;COCOA&mdash;COFFEE&mdash;TEA</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Cakes</i>.&mdash;Cakes made with fat resemble other batters,
except that the fat, sugar, and eggs are usually larger in amount
and the texture of the baked batter is finer and more tender.</p>

<p>When preparing cake, first get the pans ready. Grease them or
line them with greased paper. Make sure that the oven is at the
proper temperature. For a small cake, the oven should be hot enough
to brown a piece of unglazed <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg100"
id="pg100">100</a></span>paper or a tablespoonful of flour in three
minutes. Bake a small cake from twenty to thirty minutes. When
done, the cake will shrink from the sides of the pan; the crust
will spring back when touched with the finger; the loud ticking
sound will cease; a fine knitting-needle will come out clean if the
cake is pierced; and the crust will be nicely browned. When the
cake is removed from the oven, let it stand in the pan for about
three minutes, then loosen, and turn out gently. Do not handle
while hot. Keep in a clean, ventilated tin box in a cool, dry
place.</p>

<p><i>Cocoa.</i>&mdash;Chocolate and cocoa are prepared from the
bean of a tropical tree. This bean is rich in protein, fat,
carbohydrate, mineral matter, and a stimulant called theobromine.
In the preparation of chocolate the seeds are cleaned, milled, and
crushed into a paste. In the preparation of cocoa much of the fat
is removed, and the cocoa is packed for market in the form of a
fine powder. Cocoa is more easily digested than chocolate, because
it contains less fat. Though the amount of cocoa used in a cup of
this beverage is not large, when prepared with milk it serves as a
nutritious food. It is slightly stimulating as well, because of the
theobromine present and because it is served hot.</p>

<p><i>Coffee and Tea.</i>&mdash;Coffee and tea have no food value
when prepared as beverages. They contain stimulating properties
that are harmful to the body if taken in large quantities and, on
this account, they should be used with discretion. They should
never be given to children or to those troubled with indigestion.
If carelessly prepared, both coffee and tea may be decidedly
harmful to the body. Coffee should not be boiled for more than
eight minutes. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg101" id=
"pg101">101</a></span>Tea should never be permitted to boil. Fresh,
boiling water should be poured on the leaves and left for three
minutes. It should then be strained off and kept hot until
used.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>It may be wise to give this lesson on some special occasion, as
it is well adapted to serve for the refreshments for a mother's
club or a little class party.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg103" id=
"pg103">103</a></span>LESSON XVIII: YEAST BREAD</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Yeast bread is made light by the presence of a gas produced by
the action of yeast in the sponge or dough. Yeast is a microscopic
plant which grows in a moist, warm temperature and feeds on starchy
materials such as are present in wheat. A portion of the starch is
converted into sugar (thus developing new and pleasant flavours),
and some is still further changed, giving off the gas upon which
the lightness of the bread depends. If the yeast is allowed to work
for too long a time or the temperature is very hot, a souring of
the dough may result. This souring can be prevented by kneading the
dough thoroughly, as soon as it has risen well or doubled in bulk,
or by putting it in a very hot oven to bake, when it has reached
this stage. The yeast plant thrives in a heat of about the same
temperature as our bodies. A little extra heat will only make it
more active, but boiling temperature will kill it. Cold makes yeast
inactive, though it does not kill the plants.</p>

<p>Yeast develops in a natural state on hops and other plants. It
is prepared for market in the form of dry or moist cakes. The
latter must be kept very cold. For home use, a liquid yeast is
often prepared from the dry cakes. This has the advantage of being
more active.</p>

<p>When the yeast has been added to a batter, it is spoken of as a
sponge. When the batter has had enough flour added, so that it may
be handled, it is called a dough. If the bread is to be made in a
few hours, the yeast is made up at once into a dough. If it is to
stand overnight, a sponge is often made first. More yeast is
required for quick rising. In ordinary circumstances, one yeast
cake is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg104" id=
"pg104">104</a></span>sufficient for one quart of liquid. Thorough
kneading and baking are both essential to the success of the
bread.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Arrange to have the class meet the afternoon before, in order to
begin the process by making the sponge, and to come early in the
morning to care for the dough. Begin the study of flour, yeast, and
bread in a previous class period, correlating the work with
geography, nature study, or some other subject. Either white or
whole-wheat flour may be used for the breads.</p>

arrangements can be made to do some of the baking at the home of
one of the pupils. Use the bread for the school lunch or divide it
among the class to take home.</p>

<p>Plan a bread contest, so that each pupil will be interested in
making bread at home.</p>

MEAT&mdash;BAKED OMELET&mdash;MACARONI AND CHEESE</div>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN AND METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>At some previous time the teacher should discuss with the pupils
the plans for the dinner. It may be well to let them invite the
members of the school board or others interested in their work to
partake of the dinner. They should decide on the menu, with the
help and suggestions of the teacher, and should choose foods that
they can bring from their homes. The main course should consist of
such a vegetable dish as baked beans, an omelet, or macaroni with
white sauce and grated cheese. To accompany this there should be
potatoes and a fresh green vegetable, such as spinach or cabbage,
and a hot bread.</p>

<p>A simple dessert which the pupils know how to make should be
chosen. One duty should be assigned to each pupil, and she should
be entirely responsible for that portion of the dinner. The teacher
should supervise all the work carefully.</p>

<p>Instructions for making the menu cards may be given in a drawing
lesson.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XX: SUGAR</div>

<p class="three"><i>Food value and cooking. The use of peanuts in
candy. Peanut cookies, or peanut, molasses, or fudge candies, to be
made for a special entertainment.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Sugar is valuable to the body as a source of heat and energy.
While it is easy of digestion, it is very irritating to the body if
taken in large quantities and, on this account, it should be taken
in small quantities and preferably at meal time or with other food.
Two or three pieces of candy taken at the end of the meal will not
be hurtful, but when eaten habitually between meals, it is sure to
produce harmful effects.</p>

<p>Sugar is present in many fruits and in most vegetables. Milk
contains a large percentage of sugar. In preparing foods to which
the addition of sugar seems desirable, care should be taken not to
add it in large quantities.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg108" id=
"pg108">108</a></span>As it is desirable to have a discussion
regarding sugar and its value to the body, the preparation of
cookies or candy for some school function or Christmas party may be
undertaken in conjunction with this lesson, which should be given
at a time when it will mean most to the pupils. The work should be
so planned that they will learn something of the principles of
sugar cookery, as well as the specific recipes they are using.</p>

<h3>TWENTY LESSONS IN SEWING</h3>


<h5>SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER</h5>

<p>The teacher should be familiar with the conditions in which the
pupils live, should know how much money they can afford to pay for
materials, what materials are available, what previous experience
in hand work they have had, whether they can afford to have
sewing-machines in their own homes, and to what extent they make
their own clothes or buy them ready-made.</p>

<p>The lessons should be planned to furnish hand training, to give
pupils practical instruction in the care of their own clothes, and
to provide an opportunity for preparing the apron for the cooking
lessons. The lesson course should tend to develop habits of thrift,
industry, and neatness. The pupils should be encouraged to learn to
sew, both to improve their own home conditions and to give them
suggestions as to a possible means of livelihood. If
sewing-machines are available and are in use in the homes, it is
well to have lessons given in machine sewing and to have the long
seams run by machine. If the pupils cannot have sewing-machines in
their own homes, the lessons given should be limited to sewing by
hand. In some schools, it may be necessary to simplify the lessons;
in others, an increased number of articles may be prepared in the
time allotted. Should the apron and cap not be needed for the
cooking class, an undergarment (corset cover) may well be
substituted.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>Should the teacher
feel that an apron or corset-cover is too large a piece for her
pupils to undertake, and should she desire to have more time spent
on the first ten lessons. Lessons XI to XVIII may be omitted, two
periods each devoted to both Lessons XIX and XX, and three lessons
used for the making of a simple needle-book or other small
piece.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg111" id=
"pg111">111</a></span>For each lesson the teacher should have in
mind a definite plan of procedure. The lesson should be opened with
a brief and concrete class discussion of the new work that is to be
taken up or the special stage that has been reached in work that is
already under way. Though individual instruction is necessary, it
should not take the place of this general presentation of the
subject-matter, which economizes time and develops the real thought
content of the work. Whenever possible, the teacher should
endeavour to correlate this work with the other subjects on the
curriculum.</p>

<p>New stitches may be demonstrated on large pieces of scrim, with
long darning-needles and coarse red or black yarn. The scrim should
be pinned to the black-board with thumb tacks, and the stitches
made large enough for all to see without difficulty. A variety of
completed articles should be kept on hand, in order to show
additional application of points brought out in the lesson. Each
class may be given the privilege of preparing one article to add to
this collection, and a spirit of class pride and valuable team work
may be thereby developed.</p>

<p>During the lesson, posture, neatness, and order should be
emphasized. Application can be secured by making the problems of
interest. Care must be taken that none of the work demands
unnecessary eye strain. Each lesson should be closed in time to
have one of the members of the class give a brief summary of the
steps that have been covered.</p>

<p>Since the class period for sewing in the rural school will
necessarily be brief, the pupils should be encouraged to continue
their work at some other period. However, no work outside of the
class period should be permitted until the pupil has mastered the
stitch and can be trusted to do the work in the right way. The
privilege of sewing may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg112"
id="pg112">112</a></span>made the reward for lessons quickly
learned, home practice may be assigned, or the class may meet out
of school hours. All outside practice must be carefully supervised,
the pupil bringing her work to the teacher for frequent
inspection.</p>

<p>If it is possible to keep on hand a permanent equipment for
sewing, the following should be provided for a class of twelve:</p>

teaching of sewing.</p>

<p class="three"><i>Preparation and use of working equipment:
Needles, pins, thread, tape-measure, thimble, scissors, box for
work. Talk on cleanliness and neatness (care of hands, etc.).
Discussion of hemming. Hems folded on sheets of paper.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>A hem is made by twice turning over the edge of a piece of cloth
toward the worker, and then sewing it down. It is used to finish a
narrow edge. In turning a narrow hem the first fold must not be so
deep as the second, in order that the hem may lie smoothly. If the
hem is a wide one, the first fold can be much narrower than the
second.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should have interested the pupils in the sewing
lessons before the first meeting of the class, and each pupil
should be asked to bring with her the box in which to keep her
materials and such other equipment as is required. If the school is
to furnish the equipment, the teacher should be sure that there is
an adequate supply on hand.</p>

<p>It will probably be necessary to have the towels to be used in
the cooking classes hemmed, and the pupils should be interested in
doing this work. If some of them wish to hem towels for use in
their own homes, it may be desirable to allow them to do so. Flour
or meal sacks will answer. It may be well to have each pupil hem a
towel for home use, as well as for school use, in order to impress
upon her the desirability of having hemmed dish-towels for daily
use. The towels may be planned during this lesson, and the pupils
may arrange to bring the material from home, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg114" id="pg114">114</a></span>if they are to
provide it; but it will be well for the teacher to have on hand
material for one or two towels. Plain paper will answer for the
practice folding of the hem in the first lesson.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should devote a few minutes to a talk on
cleanliness, emphasizing its importance, and the necessity for
exercising care in handling the sewing materials. This should be
followed by a discussion regarding the care of the hands and the
condition in which they should be for the sewing lesson. Each pupil
should inspect her own hands and show them to the teacher.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus128.jpg"
alt="Gauge" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>
2.&mdash;Gauge</div>

<p>When all the pupils have their hands in a proper condition for
sewing, the teacher should look over their supplies with them, give
them suggestions as to how they are to keep these, and let them
arrange their boxes.</p>

<p>Next, she should tell them what their first work is to be, show
them the material for the towels, and discuss with them the best
method of finishing the ends. <a href="#pg115">(See Lesson II.)</a></p>

<p>Before turning the hem, the pupils should make a gauge from
heavy paper, notched to indicate the depth of the hem. A few
minutes should be devoted to practice <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg115" id="pg115">115</a></span>in measuring and turning a
hem of the desired depth on a sheet of paper. This should give
practice in the double turning necessary&mdash;first, the narrow
turn to dispose of the cut edge; second, the fold to finish the
edge.</p>

<p>When the lesson is finished, the boxes should be put away in
systematic order, and all scraps should be carefully picked up from
the desks and the floor.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON II: HEMMING TOWELS</div>

<p class="three"><i>Turning and basting hems. Hemming towels of
crash, sacking, or other material, for use in washing and drying
dishes at home or in school.</i></p>

alt="Even basting" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

3.&mdash;Even basting</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Basting is used to hold two pieces of material together until a
permanent stitch can be put in. It is done by taking long stitches
(one-fourth inch) from right to left and parallel to the edges that
are to be basted together. In starting, the thread is fastened with
a knot; when completed, it is fastened by taking two or three
stitches one over the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg116" id=
"pg116">116</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should have the necessary materials on hand or
should see that they are supplied by the pupils. The articles
needed will include material for the towels, white thread for
basting and hemming, and gauges for measuring.</p>

<p>The teacher should also have a large square of unbleached cotton
or canvas, 18 by 18 inches, and a large darning-needle and coloured
worsted thread, to use for demonstration purposes. The canvas
should be fastened to the black-board, where the class can see it
easily.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>As soon as the class is called, the supplies are at hand, and
the hands are in a proper condition, the teacher should demonstrate
the basting-stitch, with a large needle and thread, on the square
of canvas that has been fastened on the wall. Materials for work
should be passed. Each pupil should straighten the ends of her
towel by drawing a thread. Then she should turn and baste a hem
three eighths of an inch in depth.</p>

<p>At the close of the lesson, the pupils should fold their work
carefully and put it neatly in their boxes.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON III: HEMMING
TOWELS&mdash;Continued</div>

<div class="center2"><i>The overhanding stitch and the hemming
stitch.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p><i>Overhanding</i> (also called overseaming or top
sewing).&mdash;The edges to be overhanded are held between the
first finger and the thumb of the left hand, with the edge parallel
to the first finger. The needle is inserted just below and
perpendicular to the edge. The needle is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg117" id="pg117">117</a></span>pointed straight toward the
worker. The stitches proceed from right to left, each stitch being
taken a little to the left of the preceding stitch. The stitches
should all be straight on the right side, but they will slant a
little on the wrong side. They should not be deep. It may be
desirable to use this overhanding stitch at the ends of hems, to
hold the edges of the material together. The overhanding stitch is
also used for seams, for patching, and for sewing on lace.</p>

alt="Overhanding" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

4.&mdash;Overhanding</div>

<p>The overhanding of narrow hems is not always necessary, but the
ends may be made stronger thereby, and the stitch is a valuable one
for the pupils to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg118" id=

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus132.jpg"
alt="Hemming" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

5.&mdash;Hemming</div>

<p><i>Hemming.</i>&mdash;The hemming-stitch is placed on the inside
of the hem. The end of the basted hem is laid over the first and
under the second finger of the left hand, with the folded edge
outside and the material toward the worker. It is held in place
with the thumb. The stitch is begun at the end of the hem. The
fastening of the thread is concealed by slipping it underneath the
hem in the inside fold of the material. The needle is pointed over
the left shoulder, a small stitch is taken by inserting the needle
through the material just below the hem, then through the folded
edge. This is repeated, making the next stitch nearer the worker
and moving the goods away from the worker as necessary. Uniformity
of slant, size, and spacing of the stitches is important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg119" id=
"pg119">119</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Before this lesson is given, all the pupils should report to the
teacher, having both ends of their towels basted, so that they will
all be ready to proceed at once with the new stitches.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should begin by demonstrating on the large square of
canvas with the large needle and heavy thread the stitches to be
used. After overhanding the end of the hem, the hemming-stitch
should follow with the same thread. The pupils will probably not be
able to finish the hemming in this first lesson, so provision
should be made for additional time. This can be required as an
outside assignment, if the pupils have mastered the method during
the class period. The teacher may also be able to give them some
supervision while she is looking after other classes.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON IV: BAGS</div>

<p class="three"><i>A school bag. Bag (made of material obtainable)
to hold sewing materials. Measuring and straightening the material
for the bag. Basting the seams.</i></p>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>The basting-stitch will be used as a review of work in the
second lesson.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Some time before the lesson, the teacher should discuss with the
pupils the kind of material they will be able to provide for their
bags and, if the material has to be purchased, she should suggest
something that is suitable, washable, and inexpensive. The bag
should cost only a few <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg120" id=
"pg120">120</a></span>cents. The dimensions of the finished bag
should be about 12 by 18 inches.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The pupils should get out the materials they have brought and
determine upon the size and shape of their bags. It will not be
necessary to make them uniform. The teacher should help the pupils
to use their material to the best advantage. It should be
straightened, pulled in place, and measured carefully. When the
bags have been cut out, the sides should be basted.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON V: BAGS&mdash;Continued</div>

<div class="center2"><i>Sewing up the seams with a running-stitch
and a back-stitch.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Running is done by passing the needle in and out of the material
at regular intervals. Small, even stitches and spaces should follow
consecutively on both sides of the material. The stitches should be
much shorter than those used for basting, the length being
determined largely by the kind of cloth used.</p>

<p>When running is combined with a back-stitch, two or more
running-stitches and one back-stitch are taken alternately. The
back-stitch is a stitch taken backward on the upper side of the
cloth, the needle being put back each time into the end of the last
stitch and brought out the same distance beyond the last
stitch.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should be sure that all the pupils are ready to
report, having the sides of their bags basted ready for
stitching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg121" id=
"pg121">121</a></span></p>
<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should first demonstrate the running-stitch with the
back-stitch, and the pupils should begin to sew the sides of the
bag, using this stitch. They should commence sewing three quarters
of an inch from the top of the bag, so that there will be a space
left for slits in the hem through which to run the cord.<a name=
"FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=

<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>Overcasting is done by taking loose stitches over the raw edge
of the cloth, to keep it from ravelling or fraying.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The teacher should be sure that all the pupils are ready to
report, having the sides of their bags neatly sewed with the
running-stitch.</p>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

7.&mdash;Overcasting</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should demonstrate the method of overcasting and
explain its use. She should have the pupils trim the edges of their
seams neatly and overcast them carefully. After the seams have been
overcast, she should discuss the depth of the hem that the pupils
expect to use <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg123" id=
"pg123">123</a></span>and the method of turning and basting it.
They should then measure, turn, pin, and baste the hems, using the
gauge for determining the depth of the hem. If the bags are deep
enough to admit of a heading at the top, a deep hem (about
2&frac12; inches) can be made, and a running-stitch put in one-half
inch (or more) above the edge of the hem, to provide a casing, or
space, for the cord. If it is necessary to take a narrow hem, the
hem itself can be made to answer as space for the cord; in this
case the hem should be made about one-half inch deep.</p>

<p>Review of the hemming-stitch and the running-stitch.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The pupils, having the hems basted, should report to the
teacher.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should review briefly the method of making the
hemming-stitch and the running-stitch, asking the pupils to
describe these stitches and to demonstrate them on the large square
of canvas before the class. The basted hems should then be sewed
with the hemming-stitch.</p>

<p>After the hem is finished, the pupils should run a basting
thread around the bag, to mark the location of the running-stitch,
which is to be half an inch above the hem. They should measure for
this carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg124" id=

<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>To make a cord, it is necessary to take more than four times as
much cotton as the final length of the cord will require, for some
of the length will be taken up in the twisting of the cord. It will
be easier for two to work together in making a cord. The cord
should be doubled, the two lengths twisted together firmly, and the
ends brought together again and held in one hand, while the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg125" id="pg125">125</a></span>middle is
taken in the other hand, and the lengths are allowed to twist
firmly together. The ends should be tied, and the cord run into the
bag with a bodkin or tape-needle. If one cord is run in from one
side and another is run in from the other side, each cord running
all the way around, the bag can be drawn up easily.</p>

9.&mdash;Bodkin</div>

<p>In place of the cord, narrow tape may be used. Take two pieces
of tape, each piece being twice as long as the width of the bag
plus two inches. Run one tape in from one side and a second from
the other side, each tape running all the way around. Join the tape
ends in the following manner:</p>

<p class="one">1. Turn a narrow fold on one end of the tape to the
<i>wrong</i> side, and on the other end of the tape to the
<i>right</i> side.</p>

<p class="one">2. Slip one fold under the other and hem down the
folded edges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg126" id=
"pg126">126</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>If the pupils are not able to supply cords for their own bags,
the teacher should have a sufficient supply of cord on hand. She
should be sure the bags are in readiness for the cord before the
class period.</p>

alt="Completed bag" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

10.&mdash;Completed bag</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should begin the lesson by describing the method of
making the cord, estimating the amount necessary, and demonstrating
the process with the assistance of one of the pupils. The pupils
should be numbered, so that they may work in groups of two. After
they have completed the cord and run it into the bag, methods of
finishing the ends neatly should be suggested to them.</p>

alt="Darning" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

11.&mdash;Darning</div>

<p>This lesson will involve running and weaving. Darning is used to
fill in a hole with thread, so as to supply the part that has been
destroyed or to strengthen a place which shows signs of weakness. A
darning-ball, a gourd, or a firm piece of cardboard should be
placed under the hole. The darn should extend one quarter of an
inch beyond the edge of the material, beginning with fine stitches
in the material, making rows running close together in one
direction, then crossing these threads with rows that run at a
right angle to them. Care should be taken alternately to pick up
and drop the edge of the material around the hole, so that no raw
edges will be <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg128" id=
"pg128">128</a></span>visible, and to weave evenly in and out of
the material and the cross threads.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Each pupil should provide a pair of stockings with a few small
holes and a gourd or ball of some sort that she can use as a
darning ball.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>When the class meets, the teacher should discuss briefly the
care of the feet and of the stockings, and demonstrate the method
of darning, on a large piece of coarse material, with heavy yarn
and a needle. If the pupils finish one darn during the lesson
period, more darning should be assigned for practice out of
class.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON X: PATCHING<a name="FNanchor_6" id=

<div class="center2"><i>Hemmed patches on cotton garments. Talk on
the care of the clothes.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>This lesson will involve measuring, trimming, basting, and
hemming. A patch is a piece of cloth sewed on to a garment to
restore the worn part. The material used for the patch should be as
nearly like the original fabric in colour and quality as possible.
In placing the patch, the condition of the material about the hole
must be taken into consideration, as well as the size of the hole.
The worn parts around the hole should be removed, and the hole cut
square or oblong. The patch should be, on all four <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg129" id="pg129">129</a></span>sides, an inch
larger than the trimmed hole. The corners of the hole should be cut
back diagonally, so that the edges may be turned under. The patch
should be matched and pinned to the wrong side of the garment,
leaving the edges to project evenly on all four sides. The edges of
the material around the hole should be turned in and basted to the
patch. The edges of the patch should be turned in so that they
extend, when finished, one-half inch from the edge of the hole. The
patch and the cloth should be basted together and hemmed.</p>

12.&mdash;Patching</div>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>The lesson on patching should be given at any time in the course
when it can be applied to an immediate need. If a pupil tears her
dress while playing at school, or if she wears a torn apron, the
teacher can announce a patching lesson for the next sewing class,
and request each pupil to bring a torn garment and the material for
the patch from home. It may be desirable to use two or three
periods for this lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg130" id=
"pg130">130</a></span></p>
<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should demonstrate the process of patching on a
large piece of cotton. The pupils should practise placing a patch
on a piece of paper with a hole in it. Each step should be assigned
in succession&mdash;examination of the article to determine its
condition, calculation of the size and preparation of the patch,
placing the patch, trimming the article around the hole, basting
the patch and material together, and hemming the patch.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XI: CUTTING OUT APRONS OR
UNDERGARMENTS</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>When cutting out an apron, the length of the skirt should first
be measured, and to this measure 6 inches should be added for the
hem and the seams. One length of the material corresponding to this
length should be cut. This should be folded lengthwise through the
middle. Three quarters of an inch should be measured on this fold,
and the material cut from the end of the selvage to this point, in
order to slope the front of the apron. When the waist measure is
taken, 3 inches should be added to it (1 for the lap and 1 at each
end, for finishing). This makes a strong piece at each end for the
button and button-hole. Two pieces of this length and 2&frac12;
inches wide should be cut lengthwise of the material for the belt.
A measure should be made from the middle of the back of the waist
line, over the shoulder, to a point 5 inches to the right to the
centre front and on the waist line. Two pieces of the length of
this measure and 4&frac12; inches wide should be cut lengthwise of
the material for the shoulder straps. A piece 9 by 12 inches should
be cut for the bib, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg131" id=
"pg131">131</a></span>the longer distance lengthwise of the
material. These measurements allow one quarter of an inch for
seams.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Before the lesson the teacher should see if arrangements can be
made to secure the use of one or two sewing-machines, so that the
pupils may sew all the long seams by machine.</p>

<p>At a previous lesson she should discuss the kinds of material
suitable for the aprons. The pupils should consider whether their
aprons shall be white or coloured, and whether they shall be of
muslin, cambric, or gingham. Each pupil will need from 1&frac12; to
2 yards of material, according to her size. The taller ones will
need 2 yards.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus145.jpg"
alt="Cutting out skirt of apron" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

13.&mdash;Cutting out skirt of apron</div>

<p>There should be on hand a sufficient number of tape-measures,
pins, and scissors, so that the pupils may proceed with the cutting
of their aprons without unnecessary delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg132" id=
"pg132">132</a></span>The apron to be made is to have a skirt, with
a bib and shoulder straps, in order to be a protection to the

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> If the pupils are
very inexperienced and find the sewing difficult, it may be
advisable to omit the bib and straps and to make the simple
full-skirted apron. If a machine is not at hand to use for the long
seams, the limited time may make the simpler apron necessary. This
will give more time for the various steps. Lessons XIV and XV may
then be omitted, Lesson XVI made more simple, and less outside work
may be required.</p>
</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>As soon as the class meets, the pupils should take the
measurements for their aprons. One measurement should be assigned
at a time, and the reason for each measurement should be given. The
pupils should have explicit directions as to the measurements, as
they are apt to become confused if the directions are not clear.
They should work carefully, so that the material does not become
crumpled or soiled and, at the conclusion of the lesson, they
should fold it carefully and put it away neatly. All threads and
scraps of material should be carefully picked off the floor and the
desks, and the room left in order.</p>

<div class="center">LESSON XII: APRONS OR

<div class="center2"><i>Basting the hem for hemming on the machine
or by hand. Uneven basting.</i></div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>An uneven basting forms the better guide for stitching. In
uneven basting, the spaces are made about three times as long as
the stitches. The stitch should be about one eighth of an inch and
the space three eighths of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg133" id=

<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>In addition to the apron material which has been cut out in the

(number sixty white thread will probably answer for all the work),
a piece of cardboard 5 inches wide for a gauge, and pins to use in
fastening the hem.</p>

gauge, to guide them in turning the hems of the skirts of their
aprons. They should make a half-inch notch in the measure for the
first turn in the material. A half-inch edge should be turned up
from the bottom of the skirt, then a 5-inch hem should be turned,
pinned, and basted carefully with uneven basting. The gauge should
be used for both measurements.</p>

<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>In gathering, a stitch much like running is employed. Small
stitches are taken up on the needle, with spaces twice as great
between them. The top of the skirt should be divided into halves,
and each half gathered with a long thread, fine stitches one
quarter of an inch from the edge being used. The middle of the belt
and the middle of the top of the skirt of the apron should be
determined upon. The belt should be pinned to the wrong side of the
apron at these points, and the fulness drawn up to fit
(approximately one half of the waist measure). The skirt and the
belt should be pinned, basted, and sewn together.</p>

consideration of the best methods of fastening garments. The
position of the button is measured by drawing the right end of the
band one inch over the left end. The place for the button should be
marked with a pin on the left end of the band. A double thread is
fastened on the right side of the band, drawn through one hole of
the button, and back through the other, and then taken through the
band close to the first stitch. A pin should be inserted on top of
the button under the first stitch, left there until <span class=

19.&mdash;Working button-holes</div>

<p>To make the button-hole, use a thread of sufficient length to do
both the overcasting and the button-holing. Beginning at the lower
right corner, overcast the raw edges with stitches one sixteenth of
an inch deep. Do not <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg141" id=
"pg141">141</a></span>overcast around the ends of the hole. As soon
as the overcasting is done, proceed with the button-holing without
breaking the thread. Hold the button-hole horizontally over the
first finger of the left hand and work from right to left. Insert
the point of the needle through the button-hole (at the back end),
bringing the point through, toward you, four or five threads below
the edge of the button-hole. Bring the doubled thread from the eye
of the needle from right to left under and around the point of the
needle, draw the needle through, and pull the thread firmly, so
that the purl is on the edge. At the end of the button-hole, near
the end of the band, make a fan, by placing from five to seven
stitches. The other end of the button-hole should be finished with
a bar made by taking three stitches across the end of the
button-hole, then button-hole over the bar, taking in the cloth
underneath and pulling the purl toward the slit. The thread should
be fastened carefully on the under side of the button-hole.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>For this lesson it is desirable to have small pieces of cotton
on hand, to use as practice pieces for the button-holes.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The teacher should demonstrate the making of a button-hole,
illustrating each step of the process on a large piece of canvas.
The pupils should sew two small strips of cotton together and cut a
button-hole one quarter of an inch from the edge, and lengthwise of
the material, to work for practice. When the button-hole has been
sufficiently perfected on the practice piece, the pupils should
make three in the apron&mdash;one in the right end of the band and
one in the end of each shoulder strap.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg142" id=

DISHES&mdash;BINDING</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>A holder 6 inches square will be satisfactory for handling hot
dishes. It can be made of quilted padding bound with tape, or of
two thicknesses of outing flannel covered with percale or denim and
bound with tape or braid. If made of the outing flannel and
covered, it should be quilted, by stitching from the middle of one
side to the middle of the opposite side in both directions, in
order to hold the outing flannel and the outside covering together.
The tape that is to be used for the binding should be folded
through the middle lengthwise; then, a beginning being made at one
corner of the padding, the edge should be basted, half on one side
and half on the other. Right-angled corners should be formed. When
basted all around, the tape should be sewn on each side with a
hemming-stitch.</p>

<p>If the holder is to be suspended from the apron band, a tape of
from 27 inches to 36 inches in length should be attached to one
corner. The raw edge at one end of the tape should be turned in.
The end should be so placed that it overlaps the corner of the
holder about half an inch and it should be basted to the holder.
The tape should then be secured firmly to the holder, hemmed down
on one edge, across the bottom, and up the other edge. The other
end of the tape should be finished with a 2-inch loop. The raw edge
should be folded over, the tape turned 2 inches down for the loop,
and basted in place. This should be hemmed across the end. One
quarter of an inch up from the end, the double thickness of tape
should be back-stitched together, and the edges of the tape should
be overhanded from there to the hemmed end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg143" id=
"pg143">143</a></span></p>
<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>Each pupil should provide sufficient denim, percale, huckaback,
or other washable material to cover the two sides of a holder 7
inches square, and enough outing or canton flannel for a double
lining. About 1&frac12; yards of straight tape one-half inch wide
will be needed for the binding and for suspending the holder from
the apron.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus157.jpg"
alt="The holder" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

20.&mdash;The holder</div>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The pupils should first carefully measure and turn the material
for the covering of the holder and then prepare the lining, basting
it all together. They should then put in the running-stitch and
finish with the binding. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg144" id=
"pg144">144</a></span>If it is not possible to complete the holder
in one period, a second lesson period should be provided, or
arrangements may be made to have supervised work done outside of
the lesson hours.</p>

21.&mdash;Cap</div>

<div class="center">LESSON XX: A CAP TO WEAR WITH THE COOKING
APRON</div>


<h5>SUBJECT MATTER</h5>


<p>The simplest cap to make will be the circular one. A pattern
should be made by drawing with a pencil and string on a piece of
wrapping-paper a circle 21 inches in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg145" id="pg145">145</a></span>diameter. The material for the cap
should be cut carefully around the circle and finished with a
narrow hem. A tape to hold the draw-string should be placed
1&frac14; inches inside the edge of the hem. A small piece of
cardboard cut about one-half inch wide should be used for measuring
the position of the tape. Bias strips three quarters of an inch
wide should be prepared for the tape, or a commercial tape three
eighths of an inch wide may be purchased. The outer edge of the
tape should be basted first and the edges joined; then the inner
edges should be basted, the edge being kept smooth. Both edges
should be neatly sewn with the hemming-stitch by hand or on the
machine. An elastic should be inserted in the band, carefully
fitted to the head, and the ends fastened neatly.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PLAN</h5>


<p>This lesson will give a good opportunity to make a cap that will
answer for a dust cap or serve as a part of the cooking uniform. If
such a cap does not seem desirable and the former lesson has not
been completed, the cap may be omitted and the work on the holder
continued.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF WORK</h5>


<p>The pupils should first make the pattern for the cap and then
cut out their material. The hem should be basted and stitched with
the hemming-stitch. The bias strip should be basted on and sewn
with a running-stitch. It will probably not be possible for the
pupils to complete the cap in one class period; but, if the
material has been cut out and the work started, they may be able to
complete it at some other time. The stitches are not new, and the
work will serve as an excellent test of the skill they have
acquired in the course.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg146" id=
"pg146">146</a></span>HOUSEHOLD SCIENCE EQUIPMENT</div>

<p>The introduction of Household Science into rural schools has
been hindered by the prevalent impression that the subject requires
equipment similar to that in the Household Science centres of towns
and cities, where provision is made for the instruction of
twenty-four pupils at one time and for from ten to fifteen
different classes each week. Owing to the expense and the lack of
accommodation, it is not possible to install such equipment in rural
schools. For this and other reasons it has been concluded that the
subject is beyond the possibilities of the rural school. That this
is not the case is shown by the fact that many rural schools in the
United States, and some in Saskatchewan, as well as a number in our
own Province, are teaching the subject successfully, with equipment
specially designed to meet existing conditions.</p>

<p>The accommodations and equipment required may be classified as
follows:</p>

<p>1. Working tables<br />
2. Cupboards and cabinets for storing the utensils<br />
3. Stoves<br />
4. Cooking and serving utensils</p>

<p>1. The provision for working tables is conditioned by the space
available, and every effort must be made to economize this space.
The equipment may be placed in the basement or in a small
ante-room. In one school in the Province very successful work is
being done in a large corridor. When a new school-house is being
erected, provision should be made by building a small work-room off
the class-room. The possibilities of a small, portable building, in
close proximity to the school, should not be overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg147" id=
"pg147">147</a></span>Where the school is provided with a large
table, this may be made of service. When used as a working table it
should be covered with a sheet of white oil-cloth. When used as a
dining-table a white table-cloth may be substituted for the
oil-cloth. If the school does not possess a table, two or three
boards may be placed on trestles, if the space at the front or the
back of the room permits, and these may be stored away when not
required. A table with folding legs, such as is shown in Figures 22
and 23, may also be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/illus161.jpg"
alt="Working drawing of folding table" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

22.&mdash;Working drawing of folding table</div>

<p>The top of the cabinet containing the utensils or an ordinary
kitchen table closed in as a cupboard underneath, may be made to
serve. Long boards, about eighteen inches wide, placed across the
tops of six or eight desks, provide good accommodation. These
should be blocked up level and should be provided with cleats at
each end, in order to prevent movement. When not in use they may
stand flat against the wall and occupy very little space. Separate
boards, resting on a desk at each end, may also be placed across
the aisles. Each of these will provide working space for one pupil.

Tables which drop down flat when not in use may be fixed to the

walls of the school-room. As schools vary in many respects, it

is not possible to outline a plan which will suit all; but that
plan should be chosen which will best meet the requirements of the
particular school.</p>

24&mdash;Household Science Cabinet for Rural Schools</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg150" id="pg150">150</a></span>2. The cupboards and cabinets to contain the utensils may take
various forms. A kitchen cabinet costing from twenty-five to
thirty-five dollars may be obtained from a furniture store, or one
may be made by a local carpenter. A large packing-case painted
brown outside and white inside (for cleanliness) is satisfactorily
used in some schools. If covered with oil-cloth, the top of this
may be used as an additional table. A few shelves placed across a
corner of the room and covered with a door or curtain may be used,
or it may be possible to devote one shelf of the school cupboard to
the storing of the utensils. It is desirable to have a combination
cupboard and table, which will contain most of the equipment,
including the stove. Figure 24 is a working drawing of such a
cabinet, which may be made by a local carpenter or by the older
boys of the school.</p>

<p>The directions for making this cabinet are as follows:</p>

<p>Obtain two boxes and cut or re-make them so that each is 30
inches high when standing on end, 12&frac14; inches across the
front inside, and 18 inches from front to back. These will form the
two end Sections, A and B. Inside the sides of these boxes nail 1
inch &times; &#8542; inch strips, to form the slides for the
drawer. The slides come within &#8542; of an inch of the front
edge. Rails may be nailed across the front. Guide pieces should be
nailed to the slides, in order to keep the drawers straight. Divide
Section A for one drawer and cupboard. The drawers may be made out
of raisin boxes cut down to the required size. To the front of each
drawer, nail a piece of beaver board or pine a little larger than the drawer
front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg153" id=

pieces 4' 9&frac12;" &times; 1&frac12;" &times; &#8542;". Space the
Sections as shown, and nail these pieces firmly to the fronts of
the larger boxes, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, top and bottom. Four end
pieces 18" &times; 1&frac12;" will be required. Fill in Section
<i>C</i>, in this case, 2' 7&frac12;", with the pieces from the box
lids or with ordinary flooring. Make a door for the cupboard from
similar material. The top is best made from good, clear, white
pine. Screw battens across, and screw the whole firmly to the box
top from the inside. If more table space is required, make a
similar bench top, which can rest on top of the cabinet when not in
use. When required, it may be placed over the desks. Steel or glass
shoes or wooden skids or battens should be fixed under the cabinet,
so that it can be pulled away from the stove and replaced easily.
The dimensions given are for a two-flame-burner oil-stove which is
30 inches high, 31 inches across the front, and 16 inches from
front to back. The middle Section, <i>C</i>, and the total height
of the cabinet may be enlarged or reduced to fit other sizes of
stoves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg171" id=

ordinary white-lead paint and allow it to dry thoroughly. If
desired, the outside of the cabinet may be finished in white
enamel, though this is somewhat more expensive than the paint or
stain recommended above.</p>

<p>All the Household Science Cabinets shown have a two-fold
purpose. In the first place, they furnish storage space for the
utensils and working space for the pupils. In the second place,
they offer a most interesting manual training project for a boys'
club. The members can make any one of them, thus correlating their
practical wood-work and the domestic science of the girls and, in
this way, exhibiting the co-operative spirit of the home and the
school.</p>

<p>3. In some cases it may be possible to use the school stove for
cooking purposes. Some schools use natural gas for heating and,
where this is the case, provision for cooking may readily be made.
Other schools situated on a hydro-electric line, may, as has been
done in one case, use electricity as a source of heat. At present,
however, the majority of schools may find it best to use one of the
many oil-stoves now on the market. One-, two-, or
three-flame-burner stoves may be obtained for general use. The
two-, or three-flame-burner stoves are recommended, as they are
less likely to be overturned. The one-flame-burner stove, however,
is often useful as an additional provision. A good grade of oil
should be used, and the stove should be kept scrupulously clean,
constant attention being paid to the condition of the wick. Any oil
spilt on the stove when it is being filled should be carefully
wiped off before lighting. If attention is paid to these details,
the stove will burn without any perceptible odour.</p>

<p>4. The number of the utensils and the amount of equipment depend
upon the community and the number of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg172" id="pg172">172</a></span>pupils to be considered. By
careful planning few utensils are needed. They should be as good as
the people of the neighbourhood can afford and, in general, should
be of the same character as those used in the homes of the
district. All the table-cloths, towels, dish-cloths, etc., required
should be hemmed by the pupils. Articles for storing supplies may
be bought or donated. Glass canisters with close lids are best, but
as substitutes, fruit jars, jelly glasses, or tin cans will serve
the purpose. It is an easy matter to secure an empty lard-bucket or
a syrup-can for flour or meal, empty coffee-cans for sugar or
starch, etc., and baking-powder or cocoa-tins for spices. Each
should be plainly labelled.</p>

<p>Several typical lists of equipment in Household Science are
given here. These may be modified to suit particular circumstances.
Considerable expense may be saved if the pupils bring their own
individual equipment&mdash;soup-bowl, cup and saucer, plate, spoon,
knife, fork, and paper napkins. This plan is not advised unless it
is absolutely necessary, but, if followed, an effort should be made
to have the articles as uniform as possible.</p>

<p>The following equipment is that contained in the cabinet
illustrated on page 152 and is sufficient for giving organized
instruction to six pupils. If a noon lunch is provided, additional
individual equipment will be required.</p>

<p>In the equipment for twelve pupils, three one-burner oil-stoves
at $6.50 each might be used in place of the second large stove. In
this case extra provision must be made for storing the stoves when
not in use, as the cabinet shown does not provide space for more
than one large stove. Care should be taken in using the one-burner
stove to avoid upsetting it while it is in use. The equipment given
above is generous, and reductions may be made if necessary. In any
case it is not advisable that the whole equipment should be
purchased at once; only sufficient to make a beginning should be
secured, and further utensils may be added as the necessity for
their use arises.</p>

<p>If a hot dish is served at the noon lunch, as is most desirable,
the following will be needed in addition, in order to serve
twenty-four pupils:</p>

<h5>HECTOGRAPH</h5>

<p>The hectograph is a device for making copies of written work.
Teachers whose schools have limited black-board space will find it
of great service. Recipes and other rules for work may be copied
and distributed to the pupils, and thus kept in a permanent form.
Many other uses in connection with the general work of the school
will suggest themselves.</p>

<p>The following are the directions for making:</p>

<p>Soak 1&frac12; ounces of white glue in three ounces of water
until it is well softened. Cook in a double boiler until the whole
mass is smooth. Remove from the fire and add six ounces of
glycerine. Mix well, re-heat, skim, and pour into a shallow pan or
on a slate. Prick the bubbles as soon as they show. Allow the
mixture to stand for twenty-four hours, and it is then ready for
use.</p>

<p>Write the material to be copied, in hectograph ink, on a sheet
of the same size as that on which the copy is to be made. Write
clearly and space carefully. Wipe the hectograph with a damp cloth.
Lay a sheet of unglazed paper on the hectograph, rub it carefully,
and take off at once. This removes any drops of water, but leaves
the surface moist. Lay the written side of the sheet on the
hectograph and rub it carefully over its whole surface with a soft
cloth, so that every particle of the writing comes in contact with
the surface of the hectograph. Leave it there for four or five
minutes. Lift one corner and peel off carefully. Lay a plain sheet
on the hectograph and rub as before. Take off as before. If the
copy is not clear, leave the next sheet on a little longer. When
sufficient copies have been made, wash the hectograph with a wet
cloth before putting it away. Keep in a cool, dry place.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg178" id=
"pg178">178</a></span>THE RURAL SCHOOL LUNCH</div>

<p>The best method of approach to Household Science in the rural
school is through the medium of the hot noon-day lunch or the
preparation of one or two hot dishes to supplement the lunch
brought from home. Owing to the fact that many pupils live far from
the school, it is impossible for them to go home for the mid-day
meal, and they are thus dependent upon lunches which they bring
with them. Very frequently the pupils are allowed to eat their
lunches where and how they please, and the method chosen is
conducive neither to comfort nor to health. In fine weather they do
not wish to lose any time from their games, and so they eat their
food while playing, or they bolt it, in order that they may get to
their play more quickly. In severe weather they crowd round the
steps or the stove and do not hesitate to scatter crumbs and
crusts. In one case even a teacher has been seen holding a sandwich
in one hand and writing on the black-board with the other.</p>

<p>In many cases the lunch does not attract the pupil. It is often
carried, without proper wrapping, in a tin pail, and it then
absorbs the taste of the tin; again, it is often wrapped in a
newspaper and is flavoured with printer's ink; occasionally, it is
wrapped in cloth not too clean. Conditions such as these are not
fair to the pupils. They come a long way to school, often over poor
roads; and it is necessary, for both their physical and their
mental development, that they should receive adequate nourishment
served as attractively as possible. Many of the defects found among
school children can be traced, to a greater or less extent, to lack
of nutrition. The United States military <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg179" id="pg179">179</a></span>draft shows that the number
of those physically defective is from seven to twenty per cent.
higher in rural districts than in towns and cities, and this
difference is not peculiar to that country. May we not reasonably
suppose that many of these defects are caused by mal-nutrition, and
that this mal-nutrition is in part due to the poor noon-day lunch?
As these defects hinder mental as well as physical development, the
question of proper nutrition through the medium of the school lunch
becomes an educational one.</p>


<h5>THE BOX LUNCH</h5>

<p>With proper care in the selection of food, the packing of the
lunch box, and rational methods of consumption, there is no reason
why the box lunch should not be nourishing, attractive, and possess
an educational value.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as an axiom that every school lunch should
be supervised by the teacher and hap-hazard methods of eating the
lunch should be prohibited. Those schools that are fortunate enough
to possess a large table can approximate somewhat to the best home
conditions, and have the table set in the proper manner, as shown
in Lesson VI, page 18. The pupils should sit round the table, at
the head of which is the teacher, and the lunch may be made to
partake of the nature of a family party. If rightly managed, the
meal, even under the unusual difficulties presented in the rural
school, may offer the most favourable opportunities to inculcate
habits of cleanliness and neatness and to cultivate good manners.
The pupils will learn something about the proper selection of food
and the importance of thorough mastication. Clean hands and faces
and tidy hair should be insisted upon, and individual drinking cups
should be encouraged. As a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg180"
id="pg180">180</a></span>manual training exercise, each pupil may
be taught to make his own drinking cup from heavy waxed paper.
Grace may be said by the older pupils in turn.</p>

<p>The table should be made to look as attractive as possible. The
pupils, in turn, might undertake to have the table-cloth washed at
home or, in place of a linen cloth, a covering of white oil-cloth
may be used. In some cases the school garden will be able to supply
flowers or a growing plant for a centrepiece. Three or four of the
larger pupils, either boys or girls, may set the table in ten
minutes, while the others are washing their hands and faces and
tidying their hair. Some such plan as this will add palatability
and cheer to the monotony of the everyday cold and often
unattractive lunch and will create a spirit of true and healthy
sociability among the pupils.</p>

<p>In schools that do not possess tables large enough to be used as
suggested above, each pupil should be required to set one place at
his own desk, as shown in the illustration on page 20. A paper
napkin may be used for a table-cloth, if a small piece of white
oil-cloth is not procurable. Each pupil retains his place until all
have finished; he should then dispose of the crumbs and leave his
desk tidy. From twenty minutes to half an hour is generally found
sufficient for the meal. There should be cheerful conversation and
restrained laughter throughout the meal, and acts of courtesy and
generosity should be encouraged. At seasons when there are no
flies, and on days when the weather is favourable, it is a pleasant
change to serve lunch out-of-doors.</p>

<p>The lunch is provided by the home, but the teacher may give some
useful lessons in Household Science by talks on the contents of the
lunch box and the proper methods of packing the same, so that the
food will keep in <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg181" id=
"pg181">181</a></span>good condition until the time for its
consumption arrives. It is the duty of the school authorities to
provide a suitable storage place for the lunch boxes. These boxes
should be kept free from dust or flies and in a place where the
food will not freeze in winter. Open shelves, so often seen, are
not suitable and a properly ventilated cupboard in the school-room
should be provided.</p>


<h5>CONTENTS OF THE LUNCH BOX</h5>

<p>The whole question of the box lunch presents a serious problem,
when we consider the large number of children who must depend upon
it for their noon-day meal. This meal should be so constituted as
to make it a real meal and not a makeshift. The same principles
which govern the preparation of the meal should govern the
preparation of the lunch box. It is said that the school lunch
should consist of "something starchy and something meaty, something
fat and something fibrous, something sweet and something
savoury".</p>

<p>With so many varieties of breads, meats, cheese, jams, etc.,
innumerable kinds of sandwiches may be made. For example, there are
brown, graham, rye, raisin, nut, and date breads, and equally many
kinds of meat. Such variety makes it quite unnecessary to have an
egg sandwich or hard-boiled eggs in the lunch box each day. While
eggs are very valuable in the diet, a lunch with hard-boiled eggs
five times each week becomes monotonous, and the appetite of the
consumer flags. With skill and thought one can make little scraps
of meat or other "left-overs" into attractive sandwiches. Ends of
meat, ground and mixed with salad dressing or cream, make delicious
sandwich fillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg182" id=
"pg182">182</a></span></p>
<h5>SANDWICH MAKING</h5>

<p class="two">The bread should be cut evenly.</p>

<p class="two">The thickness of the slice should vary with the
appetite of the consumer.</p>

<p class="two">The crust should not be removed.</p>

<p class="two">The butter should be creamed for spreading.</p>

<p class="two">Both slices should be buttered, in order to prevent
the absorption of the filling.</p>

<p class="two">The filling should be carefully placed between the
slices.</p>

<p class="two">The sandwiches should be wrapped in waxed paper, to
prevent drying.</p>

<p>As often as possible, a surprise should be included, generally
in the form of a dessert of which the pupil is fond. A surprise
adds to the pupil's pleasure in eating and, indirectly, aids
digestion.</p>


<h5>PACKING THE LUNCH BOX</h5>

<p>Much of the attractiveness of a lunch depends upon the manner of
packing. We must consider the fact that the foods must be packed
together closely and must remain so packed for several hours. This
makes careful packing a necessity.</p>


<h5>RULES FOR PACKING</h5>

<table width="90%" summary="rules for packing">
<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">1. Be sure that the box is absolutely clean.</p>
</td>

used last in the bottom of the box, unless it is easily
crushed.</p>

<p class="five">5. Lay a neatly folded napkin on the top.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h5>EQUIPMENT FOR PACKING</h5>

<table width="90%" summary="equipment for packing">
<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">Thermos bottle or jar for milk or other liquid</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The box itself should be of odourless material, permanent, and
light in weight, admitting of safe means of ventilation. Paper bags
should never be used for food containers, as it is impossible to
pack the lunch in them firmly and well and there is danger of their
being torn or of insects or flies creeping into them. Boxes of
fibre, tin, basket weave, or other material, may be used. The box
will require scrubbing, and should be frequently dried and aired
well. Many types of lunch boxes have compartments provided for the
various kinds of food.</p>

<p>Waxed paper and paper napkins, or the somewhat heavier paper
towels of much the same size, are very useful for packing lunches,
and may be obtained at a low price, particularly if bought in large
quantities. An extra napkin, either of paper or cloth, should be
put in the basket, to be spread over the school desk when the lunch
is eaten. Napkins can be made out of cotton cr&ecirc;pe at a cost
of a very few cents each. The cr&ecirc;pe may be bought by the yard
and should be cut into squares and fringed. Such napkins have the
advantage of not needing to be ironed.</p>

<p>Paper cups, jelly tumblers with covers which can now be bought
in several sizes, and bottles with screw tops, such as those in
which candy and other foods are sold, may <span class="pagenum"><a
name="pg186" id="pg186">186</a></span>all be used for packing
jellies, jams, honey, etc. The thermos bottle may be used for
carrying milk, or, if this is too expensive, a glass jar with a
tight cover may be substituted. If the thermos bottle is used, hot
drinks may also be carried.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h5>SERVING A HOT DISH</h5>

<p>The serving of a hot lunch or of one hot dish need be neither an
elaborate nor an expensive matter. Many rural schools in the United
States, some of them working under conditions worse than any of
ours, are serving at least one hot dish to supplement the lunch
brought from home. The advantages of this plan are:</p>

<p>The teacher should have a meeting of the school trustees and of
the mothers of the pupils and outline the method of procedure. It
is only in this way that the co-operation of all can be secured, and
without this co-operation there can be no success. This meeting
should be addressed by the Public School Inspector; and after <span
class="pagenum"><a name="pg187" id="pg187">187</a></span>the
consent of the parents and the trustees has been secured, the
scheme may be put into operation. Some thought will have to be
given to the organization, in order that the plan may work
smoothly. If properly organized, there need be little or no
interruption to the ordinary routine of the school.</p>

<p>The pupils, both boys and girls, should be arranged in groups,
each group taking the work in turn. Even the smallest pupils should
be allowed to take part, as there are many duties which they can
perform successfully. If each group is composed of five or six
pupils, the work may be arranged as follows: two will prepare the
dish, two will get the table or the desks ready (or each pupil may
prepare his own desk), and the others will wash the dishes.</p>

<p>The furnishing of supplies is a problem which each teacher will
have to solve for herself, according to the conditions which exist
in the community. Supplies which can be stored are best purchased
by the school trustees; while the mothers of the pupils should
furnish the perishable articles, such as milk and butter. As often
as possible, the pupils may be asked to bring various articles,
such as a potato, an apple, a carrot, an egg, etc. These may be
combined and prepared in quantities. The school garden should be
relied upon to supply many vegetables in season, thus adding
interest and life to both the garden work and the lunch. In some
districts the neighbourhood is canvassed for subscriptions in order
to provide funds to purchase supplies for the term lunches. Some
schools give a concert or entertainment in order to raise funds for
this purpose, and in others all the supplies have been purchased by
the school trustees.</p>

<p>The pupils who are to prepare the hot dish may make the
necessary preparations before school or at recess, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg188" id="pg188">188</a></span>they must so
time the cooking that the dish will be ready when required. They
should be allowed to leave their desks during school hours to give
it attention if necessary. In schools where this method is adopted,
it has been found that the privilege has never been abused, nor
have the other pupils been less attentive on account of it.
However, most of the recipes suggested later require little or no
attention while cooking.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock the assigned pupils get the dish ready for
serving and set the table. The others wash their hands, tidy their
hair, and get their lunch boxes. All pass to their places. The
pupils who have prepared the dish may serve it, using trays to
carry each pupil's supply, or the pupils may pass in line before
the serving table and to their places, time being thus saved. When
the meal is finished, the pupils rise and bring their dishes to the
serving table and stack them with the other dishes. Two remain
behind to clear up and wash the dishes, while the others go to
play. If the desks are used, each pupil is responsible for leaving
his own desk clean.</p>

<p>The pupils may be required to keep an account of the cost of the
food and to calculate the cost per head per day or per week. A
schedule of the market prices of food should be posted in a
conspicuous place, and the pupils may take turns in keeping these
prices up to date. A separate black-board may be used for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The dish chosen should be as simple as possible&mdash;a
vegetable or cream soup, cocoa, baked potatoes, baked apples, white
sauce with potatoes or other vegetables, apple sauce, rice pudding,
etc. It may be well, in some cases, to have plans made on Friday
for the following week. As a rule, each day a little before or
after four o'clock, the recipe for the following day should be
discussed, the quantities <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg189" id=
"pg189">189</a></span>worked out to suit the number of pupils, and
the supplies arranged for. The element of surprise should be made
use of occasionally, the pupils not being allowed to know the dish
until they take their places.</p>

The skins can be kept in good condition for a long time in salt
water, which makes it possible to wait until a large supply is on
hand before candying them. They should be washed in clear water,
after removing from the salt water, boiled until tender, cut into
small pieces, and then boiled in a thick sugar syrup until they are
transparent. They should then be lifted from the syrup and allowed
to cool in such a way that the superfluous syrup will run off.
Finally, they should be rolled in pulverized or granulated
sugar.</div>

improved health of the pupils, the greater interest taken in the
school by the parents, and the better afternoon work accomplished.
It has been well said: "The school lunch is not a departure from
the principle of the obligation assumed by educational authorities
toward the child, but an intensive application of the measures
adopted for the physical nurture of the child, to the end of
securing in adult years the highest efficiency of the citizen".</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg201" id=

EQUIPMENT</div>

<p>There is no school so unhappily situated or so poorly equipped
that it is unable to teach effectively the lessons previously
outlined in the "Care of the Home" and "Sewing". Now that a grant
in aid is provided by the Department of Education any rural school
may procure one of the sets of equipment for cooking suggested or
some modification thereof. As a stepping-stone to the provision of
that equipment and as a means of educating the people of the
district in regard to the advantages of teaching this branch of
Household Science, it may be advisable or even necessary, in some
cases, to attempt practical work, even where no equipment is
installed by the school authorities.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the present position of Manual
Training and Household Science in urban schools is entirely owing
to private initiative and demonstration, by which the people were
shown how and why these subjects should be included in the
curriculum of the schools. It is reasonable to suppose that the
same results will follow if somewhat the same methods are tried in
the case of the rural schools, which form such a large part of our
educational system. Two methods of giving instruction of this
character have, in the United States, been followed by successful
results.</p>


<h5>FIRST METHOD</h5>

<p>In the first of these, the teacher spends the last thirty or
forty minutes, generally on Friday afternoons, in the description
and discussion of some practical cooking problem <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg202" id="pg202">202</a></span>which may be
performed in the homes of the pupils. Before this plan is adopted,
it should be discussed with the pupils who are to take the work.
They should be required to promise that they will practise at home;
and the consent and co-operation of the parents should be secured,
as the success of this home work depends, in the first place, on
the willingness of the pupil to accept responsibility, and, in the
second place, on the honest and hearty co-operation of the
parents.</p>

<p>A meeting of the mothers should be called, in order that the
plan may be laid before them and their suggestions received. At
this meeting afternoon tea might be served. The teacher should plan
the lessons, but occasionally, particularly at festive seasons, the
pupils themselves should be allowed to decide what shall be made.
When it is possible, the food prepared at home should be brought by
the pupil to the school, in order that it may be compared with that
made by other pupils and be judged by the teacher. In other cases,
the mother might be asked to fill up a previously prepared form,
certifying to the amount and character of the work done at home by
the pupil each week.</p>

<p>The instructions placed on the black-board should be clear and
concise and give adequate information concerning materials,
quantities, and methods. They should be arranged in such a way as
to appeal to the eye and thus assist the memory. Connected
composition should not be attempted, but the matter should be
arranged in a series of numbered steps, somewhat as follows:</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After being thoroughly explained, these directions are placed in
a note-book, for the guidance of the pupil in her home practice. In
some cases, the directions are placed on properly punched cards, so
that at the end of the year every pupil will have a collection of
useful recipes and plans, each one of which she understands and has
worked out. In many lessons of this type demonstrations may be
given by the teacher and, if the food cannot be cooked on the
school stove, it may be taken home to be cooked by one of the
pupils.</p>

<p>Lessons given according to this method, by which the theory is
given in school and the practice acquired at home, need not be
restricted to cookery. Any of the lessons prescribed in the
curriculum for Form III, Junior, may be treated in the same way.
Lessons on the daily care of a bed-room, weekly sweeping, care and
cleaning of metals, washing dishes, washing clothes, ironing a
blouse and, in fact, on all subjects pertaining to the general care
and management of the home, may be given in this way.</p>

<p>Each lesson should conclude with a carefully prepared
black-board summary, which should be neatly copied into the
note-books, to be periodically examined by the teacher. The
black-board work of many teachers leaves much to be desired, and
time spent in improving this will be well repaid. Examples of
summaries of the kind referred to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg204" id="pg204">204</a></span>are to be found in the Ontario
Teachers' Manual on <i>Household Management</i>. These instructions
may be type-written or hectographed by the teacher and given to
the pupils, thus saving the time spent in note-taking.</p>


<h5>SECOND METHOD</h5>

<p>The second of the plans referred to is a modification of what is
known as the "Crete" plan of Household Science, so called from the
name of the place in Nebraska, U.S.A., where it was first put into
operation. By this plan, definite instruction is given in the home
kitchens of certain women in the district, under the supervision of
the educational authorities. It was adopted, at first, in
connection with the high schools of the small towns in that State
but, with certain modifications, it is suitable to our rural school
conditions.</p>

<p>In every community there are women who are known to be skilful
in certain lines of cookery, and the plan makes use of such women
for giving the required instruction. They become actually a part of
the staff of the school, giving instruction in Household Science,
and using the resources of their households as an integral part of
the school equipment.</p>

<p>In order to put this plan into operation, a meeting of women
interested in the school should be called and if, after the plan
has been laid before them and fully discussed, enough women are
willing to open their homes and act as instructors, then it is safe
to proceed. The subjects should be divided, and a scheme somewhat
as follows may be arranged:</p>

<table width="60%" summary="The subjects" border="0">
<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">Mrs. A. bread and biscuits</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">Mrs. B. pies and cakes</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg205" id=

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">Mrs. F. cookies and doughnuts</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="cell_list6a">
<p class="five">Mrs. G. vegetables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Six has been found a convenient number for a class, though ten
is better, if the homes can accommodate that number. Half-past
three is a good time for the classes to meet, as they then may be
concluded by five o'clock, thus leaving the housewife free to
prepare her evening meal. The day of the week should be chosen to
suit the convenience of the instructor. The classes may meet once a
week.</p>

<p>Arriving at the home of the instructor at half-past three, the
pupils are seated in the most convenient room, and the lesson is
given. During this talk the pupils are given not only the recipe,
but details as to materials, the preparation thereof, the degree of
heat required, the common causes of failure and, in fact,
everything that in the mind of a practical cook would be helpful to
the class. Notes are taken, and afterwards properly written out and
examined by the teacher of the school.</p>

<p>The instructors prepare the food for cooking, and sometimes, as
in the case of rolls and so on, they cook the food in the presence
of the pupils. When white bread is to be baked, the pupils are
asked to call, a few minutes after school, at the home of the
instructor, to watch the first step&mdash;setting the
sponge&mdash;and again the next morning before school to see the
next step&mdash;mixing the bread&mdash;and again, about half-past
eleven or twelve, to see the bread ready for the oven and, finally,
on the way back to school, to see the result&mdash;a fine loaf of
well-cooked bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg206" id=
"pg206">206</a></span>The pupils try the recipe carefully in their
own homes, not varying its terms until they are able to make the
dish successfully. When they can do this, they are free to
experiment with modifications, and there should be no objection to
receiving help from any source; in fact, it is a good thing for the
daughter to get her mother to criticize her and offer suggestions
in the many little details familiar to every housekeeper, but which
cannot always be given by an instructor in one lesson.</p>

<p>By this method the pupils learn in their own homes and handle
real cooking utensils on a real stove heated by the usual fire of
that home. If it is a good thing&mdash;and no one doubts
it&mdash;to learn Household Science in a school where everything
that invention and skill can provide for the pupils is readily at
hand, is it not worth while to enter the field of actual life and,
with cruder implements, win a fair degree of success?</p>

<p>At the end of five or six months, after the pupils have had an
opportunity to become skilful in making some of the dishes which
have been taught, it may be well to have an exhibition of their
work. Each pupil may, on Saturday afternoon, bring one or more of
the dishes she has learned to prepare to the school-house, where
they may be arranged on tables for the inspection of the judges.
The dishes exhibited should be certified to as being the work of
the pupil with no help or suggestion from anybody. Of course, work
of this kind cannot be undertaken by the "suit case" teacher. The
teacher who packs her bag on Friday at noon, carries it to school
with her, and rushes to catch a train or car at four o'clock, not
returning to the district until Monday morning, has no time for
this kind of service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg207" id=
"pg207">207</a></span>Occasionally the entire class may meet with
their instructors in the school-room. An oil-stove and the
necessary equipment may be obtained, and a demonstration may be
given by one of the instructors. By this means much valuable
instruction will be given that is not included in the regular
course. At this time also many things may be discussed that pertain
to the growth of the movement and the general well-being of the
pupils.</p>

<p>The plan is flexible and may be modified easily to suit
different localities. It calls for no outlay on the part of the
school trustees; nor are the instructors necessarily put to any
expense, as the articles prepared in giving the lessons may be used
in their own homes.</p>

<p>By the adoption of one of the plans outlined, or such
modifications of them as the peculiar requirements of the district
may demand, every rural school may do something, not only toward
giving a real knowledge of some phases of Household Science, but
also toward developing the community spirit and arousing an
interest in the school, which will benefit all concerned.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg208" id=
"pg208">208</a></span>THE FIRELESS COOKER</div>

<p>At the present time there is urgent need for thrift and economy
in all that pertains to the management of the
household&mdash;particularly in food and fuel. In the average home
much fuel could be saved by the proper use of what is known as the
fireless cooker. The scientific principle applied has long been
known and is, briefly, as follows: If a hot body is protected by a
suitable covering, the heat in it will be retained for a long time,
instead of being lost by radiation or conduction. This is why a
cosy is placed over a tea-pot.</p>

<p>In using a fireless cooker, the food is first heated on the
stove until the cooking has begun, and then it is placed in the
fireless cooker&mdash;a tight receptacle in which the food is
completely surrounded by some insulating substance to prevent the
rapid escape of the heat, which in this way is retained in the food
in sufficient quantity to complete the cooking. Sometimes, when a
higher cooking temperature is desired, an additional source of
heat, in the form of a hot soapstone or brick or an iron plate such
as a stove lid, is put into the cooker with the food.</p>

<p>The same principle is also employed in cookery in other ways.
For example, in camp life beans are often baked by burying the pots
overnight in hot stones and ashes, the whole being covered with
earth; and in the "clam bakes" on the Atlantic Coast, the damp
seaweed spread over the embers on the clams prevents the escape of
the heat during cooking. The peasants in some parts of Europe are
said to begin the cooking of their dinners and then to put them
into hay boxes or between feather beds, so that the cooking may be
completed while the family is absent in the fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg209" id=
"pg209">209</a></span>The chief advantages in the use of the
fireless cooker are these:</p>

<p>1. It saves fuel, especially where gas, oil, or electric stoves
are used. Where coal or wood is the fuel, the fire in the range is
often kept up most of the day, and the saving of fuel is not so
great. In summer, or when the kitchen fire is not needed for
heating purposes, the dinner can be started in the stove early in
the morning, and then placed in the fireless cooker, the fire in
the range being allowed to go out. During the hot weather, the use
of a kerosene or other liquid-fuel stove and a fireless cooker is a
great convenience, since it not only accomplishes a saving in fuel,
but helps to keep the kitchen cooler. The saving in fuel resulting
from the use of a fireless cooker is greatest in the preparation of
foods such as stews, which require long and slow cooking.</p>

<p>2. It saves time. Foods cooked in this way do not require
watching, and may be left, without danger from fires or of
over-cooking, while other duties are being performed or the family
is away from home.</p>

<p>3. It conserves the flavour of the food and makes it easier to
utilize the cheaper cuts of meat which, although not having so fine
a texture or flavour, are fully as nutritious, pound for pound, as
the more expensive cuts. Long cooking at a relatively low
temperature, such as is given to foods in the fireless cooker,
improves the flavour and texture of these tougher cuts of meat.
Most people do not cook cereals long enough. By this method, the
cereal may be prepared at night, cooked on the stove for about
fifteen minutes, and then put in the fireless cooker. In the
morning it will be cooked and ready to be served.</p>

<p>The fireless cooker may be used to advantage in preparing the
following: soups; pot roasts; beef stew; Irish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg210" id="pg210">210</a></span>stew; lamb stew;
corned beef and cabbage; boiled ham; baked beans; chicken
fricassee; vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, parsnips, beets;
dried vegetables, such as peas and beans; and dried fruits, such as
peaches, apples, apricots, and prunes; cereals; and puddings.</p>

<p>The fireless cookers described in the following pages are not
experiments. They have all been tested and found to be most
practical.</p>


<h5>DIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER&mdash;NO. I</h5>

<p>While there are many good fireless cookers on the market which
cost from five to twenty-two dollars, according to size and make,
it is possible to construct a home-made cooker which will give
very satisfactory results and will be considerably cheaper than one
which is purchased in the shops.</p>

<p>Materials required: A box or some other outside container; some
good insulating or packing material; an inside container for the
kettle, or a lining for the nest in which the kettle is placed; a
kettle for holding the food; and a cushion, or pad, of insulating
material, to cover the top of the kettle.</p>


<h5>THE OUTSIDE CONTAINER</h5>

<p>For the outside container a tightly built wooden box, such as
that shown in Figure 39, is satisfactory. The walls should be thick
and of some non-conducting material. An old trunk, a small barrel,
or a large butter or lard firkin or tin will serve the purpose.
Another possibility is a galvanized iron bucket with a closely
fitting cover (this has the advantage of being fire-proof). A shoe
box 15 by 15 by 28 inches is convenient in size, since it may be
divided into two compartments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg211" id=
"pg211">211</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus225.jpg"
alt="Completed fireless cooker" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

39.&mdash;Completed fireless cooker</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should have a hinged cover and,
at the front, a hook and staple, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="pg212" id=
"pg212">212</a></span>some other device to hold down the cover
tightly; an ordinary clamp window fastener answers this purpose
very well. The size of the container, which depends upon the size
of the kettle used, should be large enough to allow for at least
four inches of packing material all round the nest in which the
kettle is placed.</p>


<h5>THE INSULATING MATERIAL</h5>

<p>For packing or insulating material a variety of substances may
be used. Asbestos and mineral wool are the best, and have the
additional advantage that they cannot burn. Ground cork (used in
packing Malaga grapes), hay, excelsior, Spanish moss, wool, and
crumpled paper may also be used satisfactorily. Of these materials
crumpled paper is probably the best, as it is clean and odourless
and, if properly packed, will hold the heat better than the others.
It is wise to line the box with one thickness of heavy paper or
with several thicknesses of newspaper, to make it as air-tight as
possible. Asbestos sheeting may be used instead. To pack the
container with paper, crush single sheets of newspaper between the
hands and pack a layer at least four inches deep over the bottom of
the outside container, pounding it in with a heavy stick of
wood.</p>

<p>Place the inside container for the cooking kettle or the lining
for the inside of the nest in the centre of this layer, and pack
more crushed paper about it as solidly as possible. The method of
packing with paper is shown in Figure 40. If other material is used
it should be packed in a similar way.</p>

<p>Where an extra source of heat is to be used, it is much safer to
use some non-inflammable material such as asbestos or mineral wool.
A cheap substitute and one which is easily obtained are the small
cinders sifted from coal <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg213" id=
"pg213">213</a></span>ashes, preferably those from soft coal.
However, the cinders from hard coal burned in the kitchen range
will do. If a fire-proof packing material is not used, a heavy pad
of asbestos should be placed at the bottom of the metal lining, and
a sheet or two of this paper should be placed between the lining of
the nest and the packing material. Whatever is used should come to
the top of the inside container, and the box should be filled to
within about four inches of the top.</p>

alt="Fireless cooker, showing method of packing with
paper" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

40.&mdash;Fireless cooker, showing method of packing with
paper</div>


<h5>THE INSIDE CONTAINER</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg214" id=
"pg214">214</a></span>The inside container for the cooking kettle
or the lining for the nest in which it is to be placed should be
cylindrical in shape, should be deep enough to hold the cooking
kettle and stone, if one is used, and should fit as snugly as
possible to the cooking kettle, but at the same time should allow
the latter to be moved in and out freely. For this purpose a
galvanized iron or other metal bucket may be used, or, better
still, a tinsmith may make a lining of galvanized iron or zinc
which can be provided with a rim to cover the packing material, as
shown in Figure 41. In case no hot stone or plate is to be used,
the lining may be made of strong cardboard.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="90%" src="images/illus228.jpg"
alt="Metal lining with rim" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

41.&mdash;Metal lining with rim</div>


<h5>THE KETTLE</h5>

<p>The kettle to be used for cooking should be durable and free
from seams or crevices which are hard to clean. It should have
perpendicular sides, and the cover should be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg215" id="pg215">215</a></span>as flat as
possible and be provided with a deep lid fitting well down into the
kettle, in order to retain the steam. A kettle holding about six
quarts is a convenient size for general use. Tinned iron kettles
should not be used in a fireless cooker, for, although cheap, they
are very apt to rust from the confined moisture. Enamelware kettles
are satisfactory.</p>


<h5>EXTRA SOURCE OF HEAT</h5>

<p>Fireless cookers are adapted to a much wider range of cooking if
they are provided with an extra source of heat in the form of a
soapstone, brick, or an iron plate which is heated and placed
underneath the cooking kettle. This introduces a possible danger
from fire, in case the hot stove plate should come into direct
contact with inflammable packing material such as excelsior or
paper. To avoid this danger, a metal lining must be provided for
the nest in which the cooking vessels and stone are to be
placed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="80%" src="images/illus229.jpg"
alt="Tightly fitting lid" /></div>

<div class="center2">
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span>

42.&mdash;Tightly fitting lid</div>


<h5>COVERING PAD</h5>

<p>A cushion, or pad, must be provided, to fill completely the
space between the top of the packing material and the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="pg216" id="pg216">216</a></span>cover of the box
after the kettle is in place. This should be made of some heavy
goods, such as denim, and stuffed with cotton, crumpled paper, or
excelsior. Hay may be used, but it will be found more or less
odorous. Figure 43 shows the vertical cross-section of a home-made
fireless cooker.</p>

<h5>DIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER&mdash;NO.
II</h5>


<div class="center2">(Single Cooker)</div>

<p>Materials required: Galvanized iron can, No. 3, with a cover;
some sawdust; a covered agate pail (to be used as a cooking pail):
and two yards of denim; any old linen, cotton, or woollen material
may be used instead of denim.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF MAKING</h5>

<p>Place loose sawdust in the bottom of the can to a depth of about
three inches. Measure the depth of the cooking pail. Turn a fold
two inches greater than this depth the entire length of the denim
or other material and make a long bag. Lay the bag flat on the
table and fill it with an even layer of sawdust, so that when
completed it will still be half an inch wider than the depth of the
pail. Roll the bag around the cooking pail, so that a smooth, firm
nest is formed when the bag is placed upright in the can on the top
of the sawdust. From the remaining denim or other material make a
round, flat bag (the material will have to be pieced for this).
Fill this bag with sawdust and use it on top of the cooking pail.
The bags must be made and fitted into the can in such a way that
there will be no open spaces whatever between the sides of the
cooking pail and the can, or between the top of the cooking pail
and the cover of the can, through which the heat might escape.</p>


<h5>DIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER&mdash;NO.
III</h5>

<div class="center2">(Double Cooker)</div>

<p>Materials required: One long box and two square boxes; the long
box must be large enough to hold the other two and still leave two
inches of space all around them; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"pg218" id="pg218">218</a></span>five and one-quarter yards of
sheet asbestos one yard wide; two covered agate pails to be used as
cooking pails; and about one yard of denim or other material.</p>


<h5>METHOD OF MAKING</h5>

<p>Line the bottoms and sides of all three boxes with sheet
asbestos. In the bottom of the long box lay newspapers flat to a
depth of about half an inch. Put two inches of sawdust on top of
this layer of newspapers. Place the two square boxes inside the
long one, leaving at least two inches of space between them. Fill
all the spaces between the boxes with sawdust. Tack strips of denim
or other material so that they will cover all the spaces that are
filled with sawdust.</p>

<p>The outside box must have a hinged lid, which must be fastened
down with a clasp. Line the lid with the sheet asbestos to within
half an inch of the edge. Put a layer of sawdust one inch deep on
top of the asbestos. Tack a piece of denim or other material over
the sawdust, still leaving the edge free and clear so that the
cover may fit tightly; or the lid may be lined with asbestos and a
denim pillow filled with sawdust made to fit tightly into the top
of the box.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h5>USE OF THE FIRELESS COOKER IN THE PREPARATION OF
LUNCHES</h5>

<p>The fireless cooker should prove very useful in the lunch
equipment of rural schools, as its use should mean economy of fuel,
utensils, time, and effort. It might be made by the pupils and
would afford an excellent manual training exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg219" id=
"pg219">219</a></span>Many of the dishes in the recipes given may
be cooked in this way, but more time must be allowed for cooking,
as there is a fall of temperature in placing the food in the
cooker. When the vessel is being transferred from the stove to the
cooker, the latter should be in a convenient position, and the
transfer should be made, and the cushion placed in position, very
quickly, so that the food will continue boiling. If the quantity of
food is small, it should be placed in a smaller tightly covered
pail, set on an inverted pan in the larger pail, and surrounded
with boiling water. When there is an air space above the food in
the cooking dish, there is greater loss of heat, as air gives off
heat more readily than water.</p>

<p>The following are examples of the foods that may be cooked in a
Fireless Cooker:</p>

<p class="two">Apple sauce&mdash;Bring to boiling temperature and
place in the cooker, leave two hours.</p>

<p class="two">Apple compote&mdash;Cut the apples in halves or
quarters so that they need not be turned. Leave them in the cooker
about three hours.</p>

<p class="two">Dried fruits&mdash;Soak overnight, bring to the
boiling-point, and leave in the cooker at least three hours.</p>

<p class="two">Cream of wheat&mdash;Boil until thick, place in the
cooker, leave overnight and, if necessary, re-heat in double boiler
before using.</p>

<p class="two">Rolled oats&mdash;Boil five minutes, then place in
the cooker. Leave at least three hours and longer if possible.</p>

<p class="two">Macaroni&mdash;Boil, then place in the cooker for
two hours.</p>

<p class="two">Rice&mdash;Boil, then place in the cooker for one
hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg220" id=
"pg220">220</a></span>All vegetables may be cooked in the cooker.
They must be given time according to their age. A safe rule for all
green vegetables is to allow two and a half times as long as if
boiled on the stove.</p>

<p>In the home, where the cooking is much greater in amount than it
can be in the school, the saving in fuel, by the judicious use of
the properly made fireless cooker, is correspondingly much larger.
For example: in soups, from 2&frac12; to 3&frac12; hours use of
fuel is made unnecessary; pot roast 2&frac12; hours; beef stew
2&frac12; hours; lamb stew 1&frac12; hours; corn beef and cabbage
2&frac12; hours; baked beans 5&frac12; to 7&frac12; hours; chicken
fricassee 2 hours; dried peas, beans, and lentils 3 hours; dried
fruits 3 hours; rice pudding 1&frac12; hours.</p>
